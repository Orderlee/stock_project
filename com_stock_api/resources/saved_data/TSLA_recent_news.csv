The stock market rally came under increasing pressure Wednesday, as stocks sold off on mixed earnings reports, coronavirus cases spurring lockdowns in much of Europe and the looming election.  X  Pinterest (PINS) and ServiceNow earnings offered some hope overnight, giving a lift to several peers. But with the stock market rally reeling, all eyes are on Thursday s earnings tsunami, including Apple stock, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).  The Nasdaq composite tumbled through its 50-day line, joining the Dow Jones and S&P 500. Megacap techs, which propped up the Nasdaq on Tuesday, sold off Wednesday. Microsoft (MSFT) fell on mixed earnings. Apple stock sank to a one-month low while the FANG trio Amazon.com, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet fell back below their 50-day averages. Tesla stock and Nvidia (NVDA) closed below their 50-day lines. ServiceNow stock fell, but rebounded from its 50-day. Shopify (SHOP) tumbled toward that key level while Adobe (ADBE) is nearing the low of its base.  The most positive news from Wednesday s session may have been the surge in fear. After barely moving during the late September stock market retreat, the CBOE Volatility Index (CBOE) spiked intraday to its highest level since mid-June, though well off the March summit. The put/call ratio rose to 0.9, which is high but not extreme.  Excessive bearishness often is associated with short-term bottoms. But it doesn t have to happen right away and any bounce doesn t have to last.  Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks  Earnings After Hours  ServiceNow (NOW), Pinterest, Etsy (ETSY), Visa (V), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Livongo (LVGO) and SunPower (SPWR) reported earnings after the close.  ServiceNow rose modestly and Pinterest stock spiked. ServiceNow earnings gave a slight lift to some business software makers after several peers gave weak guidance. Pinterest earnings buoyed soon-to-report Facebook and Twitter stock, which both popped recently on blowout Snap (SNAP) results.  Visa rose modestly following weak Mastercard results. Etsy stock retreated slightly after falling just below a buy point on Wednesday. Teladoc stock and merger partner Livongo retreated as Teladoc forecast a wider fourth-quarter loss. SunPower fell modestly after rallying on sunny First Solar earnings.  Thursday Earnings  Early Thursday, Shopify stock, coronavirus vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA), Idexx Labs (IDXX) and Spotify (SPOT) are on tap.  Then the main event: Apple (AAPL), Amazon stock, Facebook and Google report Thursday night, as well as Twitter (TWTR) and many others.  Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft, Nvidia and ServiceNow stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock, Adobe, ServiceNow and Idexx Labs are IBD Long-Term Leaders. Nvidia, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft and ServiceNow are on the IBD 50.  Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures rose 0.9% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.9%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8%. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn t necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.  Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.  Coronavirus News  Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 44.73 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.17 million.  Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 9.11 million, with deaths above 233,000.  France will impose a new lockdown effective Friday, with people told to stay at home except to buy essential goods, seek medical care, exercise or go to work if their employer says the job can t be done at home. But schools will remain open. Germany will shut down bars and restaurants starting Monday. Several other European nations have imposed partial coronavirus lockdowns or other restrictions. That will take a toll on travel, consumer spending and the global economy.  So far U.S. cities and states have not sharply raised coronavirus restrictions, but Americans could stay at home more and step up social distancing measures if the pandemic continues to flare up.  Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) said Tuesday that it won t have interim coronavirus vaccine data from final-stage trials until after the Nov. 3 election, after previously signaling that it could disclose such data before the end of October.  A coronavirus vaccine won t be available until January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation s top infectious-disease official, predicted Wednesday.  Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally suffered heavy losses, closing essentially at session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.4% in Wednesday s stock market trading, undercutting its late September low to its worst level since late July. The S&P 500 index lost 3.5%, hitting its worst level since Sept. 25. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 3.7%, through its 50-day line and also to the lowest point since Sept. 25.  Microsoft became the latest software maker to give weak guidance, falling 5% Wednesday. Fellow Dow Jones stock as well as S&P 500 and Nasdaq component Apple sank 4.6%. Amazon dropped 3.8% while Facebook and Google stock dropped 5.5%. Tesla reversed 4.4%. All of these tech giants fell through their 50-day moving averages.  Shopify stock fell 5.5% after making a promising move Tuesday.  With those losses, it s not surprising the Nasdaq crumbled through its 50-day line.  Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 3.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) retreated 3.5%, with Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks notable members. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell 3.2%. Nvidia stock is a key component.  ServiceNow Earnings  ServiceNow earnings rose 22% vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 30% to $1.15 billion. Analysts had seen ServiceNow earnings of $1.03 a share on revenue of $1.11 billion.  The business software maker also guided slightly higher on subscription revenue for Q4.  The ServiceNow earnings report and guidance follow warnings or weak guidance from several software makers. German software giant SAP (SAP) issued a major warning on Sunday. Microsoft, Twilio (TWLO) and Dynatrace (DT) gave mixed guidance this week That all followed the warning by Fastly (FSLY), which missed lowered views late Wednesday.  ServiceNow stock rose 2.3% overnight. NOW stock sank 3.15% on Wednesday but found support, for now, at its 50-day line.  Adobe and Salesforce.com (CRM) edged higher after sinking more than 4% on Wednesday.  Pinterest Earnings  Pinterest earnings shot up to 13 cents a share vs. 1 cent a year earlier. Revenue leapt 58% to $443 million. Analysts expected Pinterest earnings of four cents a share on revenue of $383.5 million.  PINS stock shot up 32% in overnight trade. Shares fell 6.2% to 49.25 on Wednesday but were already greatly extended.  Facebook stock climbed 2.7% and Twitter nearly 6% after both lost more than 5% Wednesday ahead of their earnings Thursday night.  Stock Market Analysis  On Monday, IBD changed the market direction classification to ""uptrend under pressure."" Suffice it to say that the stock market rally is under even more pressure now.  With coronavirus concerns soaring and such crucial events as Thursday s earnings tsunami and next Tuesday s Election Day, it s hard to make the case to step up exposure. Apple and Amazon earnings could be great and investors cheer the election results, but that s just a guess. Right now, the stock market rally is reeling.  Dow Jones futures are up, but just a fraction of what the major indexes lost on Wednesday.  Trying to get ahead of the market rally in the past few weeks has meant jumping in just as the tide recedes.  Recent breakouts and early buy points have largely failed. Many leaders have broken down. Investors should be cutting their holdings and awaiting renewed stock market vigor before making new buys. That could come in a few days, weeks or months.

Ford stock rose.  X  Ford Earnings  Estimates: Wall Street expects Ford earnings to plunge 35% to 22 cents. Automotive revenue is seen falling 4% to $32.70 billion. That s according to Zacks Investment Research.  Results: EPS soared 91% to 65 cents on revenue of $34.7 billion, helped by stronger-than-expected vehicle demand and pricing. Management also credited the company s decision two years ago to focus on pickup trucks, SUVs and commercial vehicles and and phase out unprofitable sedans.  Adjusted EBIT hit $3.6 billion, as North America margins reached 12.5%. Ford generated $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow, led by a $4 billion rebound in supplier payables as vehicle production reached pre-pandemic levels.  Outlook: Ford expects positive full-year 2020 adjusted EBIT, including Q4 adjusted EBIT of between break-even and a $500 million loss. In July, Ford had predicted adjusted EBIT losses for Q4 and the full year.  In a hot market for trucks, Ford had its best Q3 for high-margin pickup sales since 2005. China Q3 sales also rose nearly 4% sequentially, while markets in Europe also rebounded strongly after stimulus measures, Ford said.  IBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis  Ford Stock  Shares rallied 6% late after closing down 2.5% at 7.72 on the stock market today. Ford stock is still in buy range off a 7.48 flat-base buy point. Its relative strength line is back near pre-pandemic highs. That is a sign of strong performance vs. stocks at large. But Ford s RS line is rising within a longer downtrend.  General Motors (GM) lost 2.3% Wednesday. GM s potential electric truck partner Nikola (NKLA) sank 8% and Tesla (TSLA) gave up 4.4%.  Ford earnings took a severe pandemic hit this year. Factories shut down and people stayed home. But sales bottomed in the second quarter. In Q3, Ford s auto sales climbed 27% sequentially in the U.S. The country continued to reopen after lockdowns.  The carmaker announced in Q3 that its CEO would retire, and Ford stock jumped. Investors worried that Ford s transformation wasn t happening fast enough. New CEO Jim Farley took over Oct. 1 and immediately shook up the leadership team.  Amid challenges, Ford continues to hone its electric car and self-driving strategy against Tesla.  That includes a new alliance with Intel (INTC) unit Mobileye on camera-based auto tech. It plans to launch a self-driving commercial business in 2022. Ford launched the Mustang Mach-E electric crossover this year and plans an electric Ford-150 truck in 2021.

Only so much battery energy can fit in the space a vehicle allows, and the batteries can be expensive. A more efficient car can go farther with a smaller battery.
The newest EPA data for 2021 Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) vehicles shows the company is still firmly in the lead when it comes to efficiency. It s one of the reasons Teslas have the best range of any electric cars on the planet. 
Electrek has done a comparison with some other brands, and Tesla is far ahead of the competition.
The EPA lists how much energy — in kilowatt-hours — it takes for an electric vehicle to go 100 miles.
Tesla s AWD Model 3 uses 25kWh to go 100 miles, while the two-door Mini Cooper SE, a much smaller vehicle, uses 31kWh for the same distance. This is approximately 25% more energy to go the same distance in a much smaller car. 
Benzinga s Take: Tesla s efficiency is impressive. Even the company s crossover Model Y uses less energy per mile than the much smaller Mini Cooper.
The efficiencies presented by Tesla allow lower vehicle costs, more range and a savings for customers when it comes time to charge their cars as well.

According to Consumer Reports , Tesla’s Autopilot system placed a “distant second” to GM GM, -2.29% , scoring 57 out of 100 points, vs. 69 for the Detroit auto maker.  To determine the rankings, testers put 17 of the newest driving assistance systems to the test on a private track and on public roads, rating them by dozens of measures, including steering the car, controlling the speed, ease of use and keeping the driver safe and engaged.  “Even with new systems from many different automakers, [GM’s] Super Cruise still comes out on top due to the infrared camera ensuring the driver’s eyes are looking toward the roadway,” Consumer Reports’ Kelly Funkhouser said in reference to the results.  Here’s how the top eight placed:  This isn’t the first test in which GM’s Super Cruise has managed to beat out Tesla. It also happened the last time these systems were tested back in 2018.  “Even after two years, Cadillac’s Super Cruise remained our top-rated system because, when turned on, it uses direct driver monitoring to warn drivers that appear to have stopped paying attention to the road,” Consumer Reports explained.  GM has said 22 vehicles will come equipped with Super Cruise technology by 2023, including a next-generation system with greater capabilities."

Prominent examples include Home Depot Inc. (HD), McDonald s Corp. (MCD), and Nike Inc. (NKE). Consumer discretionary companies tend to be more sensitive to the overall business cycle because consumers are more likely to reduce or postpone their discretionary purchases when times are tough. By contrast, companies in the consumer staples sector focus on essential items such as food and beverages.  Consumer discretionary stocks, as represented by the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY), have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with a total return of 25.5% compared to the Russell 1000 s total return of 15.9% over the past 12 months.﻿﻿ These performance figures are as of October 26, and all data below are as of October 27.

6,2020-10-28,12:45:00,TSLA,https://www.investors.com/research/gm-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220,Is GM Stock A Buy As General Motors Soars With Hummer EV?,"GM stock, after stalling for close to a decade, suddenly has gotten a jolt of electricity. General Motors sales snapped back in the third quarter, both in the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, GM s three big future bets are all looking more promising. GM s new Ultium battery-powered 2022 Hummer EV sold out minutes after its unveiling this week. The deal to supply fuel cells for Nikola heavy-duty trucks may go forward after all. And its Cruise s driverless vehicle unit just passed a big milestone.  X  While General Motors is turning heads with its EV ""supertruck"" and all its other progress, its stock is still priced like an underdog. So is now a good time to buy GM stock?  Hummer EV Buzz  GM unveiled the Hummer EV truck during the World Series on Tuesday, touting ""maneuverability and traction unlike anything GM has ever offered."" The Hummer s CrabWalk mode, allowing it to move diagonally to get through tight off-road spots, quickly went viral.  ""I think investors are crab-walking back to the stock,"" Morgan Stanley s Adam Jonas said on an Oct. 21 analyst call with management.  The Hummer EV, which will take on the Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck, is due out next fall. GM says the Hummer EV can travel 350 miles on a full charge and reach 60 miles per hour in three seconds. The Hummer also will take on upcoming electric trucks from Ford (F) and Amazon (AMZN)-backed Rivian.  The Rivian RT1 will likely be released before the GM Hummer, but the Tesla Cybertruck may not be out until 2022.  Prices for the initial Hummer EV version start at $112,595. General Motors said all available reservations for the Hummer EV sold out within 10 minutes, but didn t detail how many refundable $100 deposits it accepted.  GM plans cheaper Hummer EV versions in future years.  GM Stock Chart Technical Analysis  On Oct. 16, GM stock first nosed its grille into buy range, clearing a buy point at 33.43, 10 cents above its Sept. 8 high. Then on Tuesday, ahead of the that night s highly anticipated Hummer launch, General Motors announced that a third U.S. factory would be switched to making electric vehicles.  GM stock shifted into high gear. The stock advanced 6.75% to 35.60, clearing the 5% chase zone beyond which stock purchases carry higher risk.  The momentum continued the next two days on high volume, which often signals institutional buying.  General Motors stock has pulled back into a buy zone in recent days, on lower volume than the recent breakout surge.  From a broader perspective, though, GM stock is still trying to break a long slump. GM, while at a 2020 peak, hasn t yet broken above its October 2017 all-time high and isn t even level with its highest point in 2011, shortly after becoming public again.  Still, GM stock is rising toward the top of its decade-long trading range. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which shows how GM stock performs vs. the S&P 500 index, has recovered back to a nine-month high, after nearing a historic low in July.  GM-Nikola Deal Not Finalized  On Sept. 8, General Motors and Nikola announced a partnership that would see the top U.S. automaker build several versions of Nikola s Badger truck using GM s own Ultium and fuel cell technology. GM also agreed to supply fuel cells to Nikola s heavy-duty trucks, expanding GM s market opportunity. In exchange for the services it provides, GM was supposed to receive $2 billion worth of Nikola stock.  The news, which appeared to further validate GM s technological relevance, sent GM stock surging. However, the deal came into question as Nikola s stock dived as its founder left the company amid allegations of being a huckster and personal misconduct.  Yet GM President Mark Reuss sounded upbeat about being able to finalize terms with Nikola. ""The opportunity to put our fuel cells into a class 7 and 8 vehicle is spectacular,"" he told CNBC on Oct. 21.  Meanwhile, GM owns a stake in Lordstown Motors (RIDE), another electric truck startup that just went public.  General Motors  Ultium Battery Future  GM had a puzzle to solve: How could it compete broadly in the still relatively small EV market, en route to an all-electric future, without frittering away its financial strength? The answer came with the March 4 unveiling of its Ultium battery and flexible platform.  The Ultium stands apart for its ability to be stacked either vertically or horizontally in the battery pack, to optimize the layout of each vehicle. The biggest stack is said to have the power to reach 400 miles on a full charge. The platform can accommodate a wide range of trucks, SUVs and cars.  CEO Mary Barra said that GM s multi-segment EV strategy has ""economies of scale that rival our full-size truck business with much less complexity and even more flexibility.""  The first generation of GM s coming EV lineup ""will be profitable,"" the company said.  Since then, GM has detailed a much more complete vision of its EV future.  In September, GM unveiled its strategy to produce electric drive systems that are designed in-house to deliver cost and performance benefits. GM says the five drive units and three motors will offer the power and versatility to work with the full range of some 20 different EVs it plans to produce by 2023.  GM said these Ultium Drive systems ""will be more responsive than its internal combustion equivalents with precision torque control of its motors for smooth performance.""  In April, GM reached a deal with Honda that will see it jointly develop two electric vehicles for the Japanese automaker using GM s Ultium battery.  The Honda deal created a partnership model that the Nikola deal could follow. Barra said that supplying GM technology to rival automakers would build ""scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability.""  Does GM Stock Need Ultium EV Spinoff?  GM s plan has been to ride its profitable truck and crossover franchises until its electric vehicles and Cruise autonomous vehicles have proved their worth. While Covid-19 has made for a bumpy ride, GM has proved it can withstand a severe economic hit without getting off track.  Yet Wall Street has been slow to buy into GM s future as a would-be EV powerhouse and self-driving-taxi operator. That s why analysts began making the case this summer that GM s best option for joining in the EV stock boom was to spin off its Ultium battery EV operations.  Morgan Stanley s Jonas put it this way on the July 29 Q2 earnings call: ""There s so much investor enthusiasm around the 20% (compound annual growth rate) business known as EVs and not so much excitement around the negative 5%-or-so CAGR business."" Jonas referred to GM s internal combustion engine vehicle business as a ""melting ice cube, so to speak.""  On Aug. 14, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner released a note calling for a GM spinoff of its EV operations. Doing so would give it access to cheap capital and help to keep and attract top talent.  Barra reiterated that GM is committed to grow shareholder value, but whether that will result in an Ultium spinoff is far from clear. She implied that GM s focus is on building value through partnerships that help take its technology to the next level.  On Oct. 20, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli hiked his General Motors price target to 57 from 54, keeping a buy rating. He said he s gaining confidence in his optimistic long-term 100 price target for GM stock. Michaeli noted that GM could unlock value ""rather quickly.""

GM Stock Left In Tesla s Dust  As of Oct. 27, General Motors has a $50 billion market cap, compared with $395 billion for Tesla. That s despite GM sales being five times that of Tesla in Q1, before the coronavirus shutdown. Nikola, despite having no sales and fending off fraud allegations, has a market cap of $8.5 billion, though that could collapse if GM pulls the plug on the deal.  GM stock has an improving 87 Relative Strength Rating, meaning it has outperformed 87% of all stocks. Tesla stock and Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO) both have 99 RS ratings, while Nikola has a 92 RS. Ferrari (RACE) has a 70 RS Rating, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 82 and Ford 75.  General Motors has a solid 82 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99. The Composite Rating combines several key fundamental and technical factors into a single score, reflecting earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Still, IBD research shows all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs. Tesla has a 99 Composite Rating.  GM Sales Trends  In the third quarter, GM deliveries in the U.S. recovered to 665,192 vs. 492,489 amid the coronavirus lockdown in Q2. Deliveries still fell 10% from a year ago, but GM said each month saw improvement, and September sales exceeded the year-ago total.  GM restarted factories on May 18 after a two-month coronavirus suspension. Lean inventories have held back sales, but GM said that large pickup and full-size SUV plants are now all operating on three shifts and at maximum overtime.  With cheap oil prices, General Motors appears well-positioned in the U.S. market, seeing demand for pickup trucks and crossover SUVs.  Now sales in China also are on the upswing. General Motors and its Chinese joint-venture partners saw deliveries rise 12% to 771,400. GM sales outpaced the Chinese market as a whole, a nice turnaround from Q2, when deliveries fell 5% as China s market grew 10%.  General Motors Earnings  General Motors hasn t seen steady earnings growth in the past couple of years, as auto sales peaked in the U.S. and hit a pothole in China. A UAW strike hurt results in the second half 2019. Then Covid-19 marred the first half 2020, and the effect has carried into Q3.  In Q2, General Motors fared a bit worse than expected on the top line, as revenue fell 53% to $16.8 billion. Yet rigorous cost-controls resulted in a loss per share that was much narrower than anticipated: 58 cents vs. the expected loss of $1.77.  In Q3, analysts expect revenue to bounce back to $36.97 billion, up 4% from a year ago, according to Zacks Investment Research. Profitability is expected to return in Q3, with GM earnings per share down 14.5% from a year ago to $1.47 a share. After a 45% drop in 2020, analysts see GM earnings per share up 65% in 2021.  While Tesla Soars, Electric Cars Face A Huge Test  GM Cruise Vs. Tesla And Alphabet Waymo  In January, General Motors unveiled its six-passenger Cruise Origin, which has no steering wheel. But the company laid off 8% of its workforce in May as it paces itself for a future that is still just over the horizon.  Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo, Uber (UBER), Ford and Tesla are among a large field of well-funded competitors in the autonomous-vehicle market. Yet so far there s been one detour after another. Covid-19 is yet another obstacle to shared rides.  Cruise had hoped to launch a robotaxi service in San Francisco late in 2019. GM and others have been too optimistic about solving what GM CEO Mary Barra has called ""the greatest engineering challenge of our lifetime."" She s optimistic about unlocking ""the multitrillion-dollar market potential"" of self-driving cars, but some experts now think that market might not develop until late this decade.  Yet even GM s Cruise venture has started generating some excitement. Earlier this month, the company received a permit from California s first permit to test its driverless cars without a backup driver on the streets of San Francisco.  GM bought Cruise Automation for $1.1 billion in 2016. Key investors include Honda Motor (HMC), which last year put $750 million into the venture and agreed to put up $2 billion more over 12 years.  Tesla, meanwhile, released a new Full Self Driving beta version to select drivers. But the system is still considered a Level 2 system, while Cruise and Waymo are Level 4.  Is GM Stock A Buy?  GM stock is on its best run in year. The technical picture has improved dramatically. GM s 83 IBD Composite Rating is now pretty solid, but that still puts it in the second tier, not an industry leadership position. IBD research shows that all-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs.  Because GM s traditional business faces a long-term decline, and it s been through a restructuring, fundamental metrics don t tell the full story. Undoubtedly, there is lots of execution risk and uncertainty., but Wall Street sees plenty of promise developing. If analysts see GM as a ""stable of unicorns"" with high-growth potential, they could begin to use a more flattering lens for valuing future earnings.  However, there s no indication that GM will spin off its EV operations. GM joint ventures in China could be hurt if U.S.-China tensions grow. GM Cruise could turn out to be a robotaxi leader, but don t hold your breath. The biggest uncertainty may be GM s ability to compete with Tesla, which aims to drive down the price of its EVs to $25,000 in three years.  Bottom line: GM is in a buy zone, so investors could buy it, but make no mistake. GM is a speculative buy. Fundamentals are improving, but GM depends on a business that could fade away over the coming years, while making huge investments in an uncertain electric future.  Investors may find better buying opportunities in younger, faster-growing companies. To find the best stocks to buy or watch, check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content.

General Motors’ (GM) - Get Report Cadillac Super Cruise active driver assistance technology beat out Tesla’s (TSLA) - Get Report Autopilot in a Consumer Reports study announced Wednesday.  Super Cruise stomped the competition with a rating of 69 out of 100, compared to 57 for Autopilot on Tesla’s Model Y, 52 for Ford s (F) - Get Report Co-pilot 360 system and 48 for Audi’s Pre-sense. Thirteen others trailed behind.  As for Tesla’s Autopilot, which can control the car’s steering and speed to assist the driver, “most mainstream automakers now offer similar systems on their cars, and it’s quite likely that the next new vehicle you buy will be equipped with one,” Consumer Reports wrote.  Active driving assistance doesn’t represent self-driving, “but rather it’s intended to support the driver - a well-designed system can help relieve driver fatigue and stress, such as on long highway road trips or in stop-and-go traffic,” the publication said.  As for Cadillac’s Super Cruise, it “remained our top-rated system because, when turned on, it uses direct driver monitoring to warn drivers that appear to have stopped paying attention to the road,” Consumer Reports said. “Monitoring whether the driver is paying attention is a big part of the reason that Super Cruise is still tops in our ranking.”  Meanwhile, “of the other systems we tested, we saw minor improvements in lane-keeping performance for the Tesla and Volvo.”  GM stock recently traded at $33.95, down 2.69%, and has slid 7% so far this year. Tesla recently traded at $412.09, down 2.96%, but has soared 392% year to date amid investor mania for electric vehicle stocks."
8,2020-10-28,11:13:00,TSLA,https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-amd-jd-com-struggle-with-buy-point/?src=A00220,"AMD, Tesla, JD.com Struggle With Early Buy Points, But This Is The Real Problem","In the past several days, AMD stock, Tesla (TSLA) JD.com (JD) and Inphi (IPHI) have already triggered early entry points. But they have all hit resistance and pulled back just as the buy signal flashed.  X  As CAN SLIM investors get started, they should stick to traditional buy points. But as traders get more experienced, they may look for early entries to start or add to positions. A classic ""early entry"" is a downward-sloping trend line in handles. The official buy point is 10 cents above the top of the handle. But stocks often begin taking off before that, as they break the downward trend in the handle. This can be a place to start a position, perhaps filling out the stake at the traditional buy point.  However, in the past couple of weeks, that hasn t work. Tesla stock, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), JD.com and Inphi have all come up to these trend lines and quickly pulled back. That s not a necessarily bad mark on these stocks, but reflects the continued pullback in the market rally. With the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite still in a downtrend for the past two weeks, it s hard for any stocks to make real progress.  Plenty of recent breakouts have quickly failed or roundtripped big gains.  Tesla and JD.com stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AMD and Inphi stock are on the IBD 50.  Tesla Stock  Tesla stock initially tried to break above short-term resistance on Oct. 14, but has since retreated, forming a handle with a 466 buy point. Shares briefly peeked above a downward-sloping trend line on Oct. 22, right after Tesla earnings, but quickly pulled back. In the past few days, TSLA stock has been holding support at the 50-day line, but hitting resistance at their 21-day exponential moving average.  As the MarketSmith chart shows, the relative strength line has been holding near record highs, showing Tesla stock s strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index for much of 2020.  But with the major indexes retreating, Tesla stock hasn t been able to push higher. At this point, investors looking for an early entry should likely wait for TSLA stock to at least clear its Oct. 22 intraday high.  AMD Stock  AMD stock had a handle buy point of 88.82, though by the end of last week the handle was a little too low in the base to be proper. On Monday, shares popped above a downward-sloping trend line, but gave up most of its intraday gains. On Tuesday, AMD earnings crushed views, but shares tumbled as the chipmaker announced a $35 billion deal to buy Xilinx (XLNX). AMD stock fell though its 50-day line.  Moving above Monday s intraday high might offer an early entry. But right now, AMD is in danger of undercutting recent lows.  JD.com Stock  JD.com stock has a cup-with-handle buy point of 85.49. Twice in the past two weeks shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant have come up to a downward-sloping trend line, but haven t quite broken through. JD.com stock has held support at its 21-day line and its RS line is already at a record high.  Getting above the trend line — or perhaps at 84.56, just over the Oct. 21 high — might be a decent early entry just before the official buy point.  Inphi Stock  Inphi stock has a 125.93 cup-with-handle buy point. Twice in the past two weeks, the data-center chip maker popped above its downward-sloping trend line, but reversed lower. On Tuesday, IPHI stock reversed lower again, sinking to just above its 50-day line.  Inphi stock was a leader after the coronavirus crash, but the RS line has trended lower since early August.  Investors might want to wait for shares to break above the official buy point.  Inphi earnings are due Thursday. That could be a catalyst for Inphi stock up or down.  With AMD, Tesla and other leaders, investors might want to wait for the stock market rally to show real strength before trying any early entries, or perhaps any traditional breakouts.  Stocks sold off hard Wednesday morning, with the Nasdaq tumbling below its 50-day moving average, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 sank further below that key level. Tesla fell 2% in late morning trade, undercutting its 50-day line intraday once again. JD.com lost nearly 3%. AMD retreated more than 2% after Tuesday s Xilinx-linked tumble. So did Inphi.

9,2020-10-28,11:10:00,TSLA,https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-second-to-gm-super-cruise-consumer-reports-151025030.html,Consumer Reports says Tesla Autopilot is a 'distant second' to GM's tech,"The publication also found that Super Cruise was better at notifying drivers when it was about to disengage. GM’s tech not only provides a clear visual alert, but uses pre-mapped road info to notify commuters in advance that they’ll have to resume control. Tesla’s approach delivers either a loud alert or a subtle icon change when Autopilot disengages, and it’s frequently an abrupt cutoff.  It wasn’t a clear-cut victory. GM’s system tended to discourage taking over, and Tesla had clear advantages in ease of use. Both fared better than many of their rivals, though. The next-closest system was Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 (52), while even luxury brands like Audi (48), Mercedes (46) and BMW (44) fared relatively poorly. Even Volvo, a safety advocate, scored a mediocre 41.  We’ve asked Tesla for comment, but it’s not likely to be thrilled with the results given its fractious history with Consumer Reports.  Whatever car you prefer, the study suggests that semi-autonomy and other driver assistant features are a long way from being truly reliable. They may save you from the mental drain of focusing on a long highway commute, but you’ll still have to be ready to steer with very little warning."

Tech giants Apple and Tesla stumbled in morning trade, while First Solar soared 17% on strong earnings results.  X  Among the Dow Jones leaders, Apple (AAPL) fell 3% early Wednesday, while Salesforce.com (CRM) lost 3.3%. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) tumbled over 3% despite strong earnings late Tuesday. Boeing (BA) dropped over 2% on earnings.  Tesla (TSLA) skidded as much as 4% in morning trade.  Stocks on the move early Wednesday include Enphase Energy (ENPH) and First Solar (FSLR). Both reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday.  Stocks in or near buy zones in the stock market rally are JD.com (JD), Shopify (SHOP) and Tencent (TCEHY).  JD.com, Microsoft and Tesla are all IBD Leaderboard stocks.  Dow Jones Today  The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2.6%, while the S&P 500 declined 2.5%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 2.9% in morning trade.  Among exchange traded funds, Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) fell 2.1% Wednesday. The Nasdaq 100-linked Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF traded down 2.4%. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) lost 2.1%.  Amid the coronavirus stock market rally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 27.4% for the year through Tuesday s close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 5%, while the Dow is down 3.8% year to date, through the Oct. 27 close.  Coronavirus Updates  According to the Worldometer data tracker, the cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 9 million on Wednesday. Total virus-related deaths rose past 232,000.  The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 44.3 million Wednesday, with more than 1.17 million virus-related deaths.  Coronavirus Stock Market Rally  According to IBD s The Big Picture, the coronavirus stock market rally is starting to falter amid recent institutional selling.  Tuesday s Big Picture commented that ""The Nasdaq Composite s 0.6% gain ate into Monday s sell-off. That s bullish. Yet it recouped well less than half of that day s 1.6% pounding. Volume lightened vs. the prior day. This suggested institutional investors bought cautiously. And the Nasdaq itself, while holding above the 50-day moving average, is not far from testing that key technical level again.""  An uptrend under pressure means investors need to be much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash.  Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good. The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates. The RS Line Blue Dot is assigned to stocks whose RS lines are making new highs while the stock is basing or breaking out.  Stocks to watch include IBD Long-Term Leaders, companies with stable earnings growth and price performance.  Stock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest  Microsoft Earnings  Dow Jones leader Microsoft smashed Wall Street s targets for the September quarter. The company earned $1.82 a share on sales of $37.2 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts expected Microsoft earnings of $1.54 a share on sales of $35.72 billion.  With respect to guidance, Microsoft expects $39.5 billion to $40.4 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue. The middle of that range, at $39.95 billion, is below some analyst estimates for revenue of $40.43 billion.  Shares fell over 3% Wednesday after ending Tuesday just above its 50-day line amid a 1.5% gain. Shares are approaching a 225.31 buy point in a cup with handle.  Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 35.2% through Tuesday s close.  Dow Jones Earnings: Boeing  Boeing topped third-quarter forecasts Wednesday and said it expects further employee reductions amid the coronavirus pandemic and its 737 Max grounding. The company plans to lay off an additional 11,000 by the end of 2021, bringing its total number of employees to 130,000 vs. over 160,000 at the start of this year.  Boeing stock fell over 2% in early trade.  Stock Market Earnings: Enphase, First Solar  Enphase Energy advanced 3% early Wednesday. The company reported earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of $178.5 million. Analysts expected Enphase earnings to fall to 24 cents a share on revenue of $169.7 million.  First Solar soared as much as 17% in morning trade. The solar company s earnings surged 400% to $1.45 per share, with revenue up 70% to $928 million. That blew out analyst views for First Solar earnings of 60 cents a share and sales of $707.7 million.  Stocks Near Buy Zones: JD.com, Shopify, Tencent  JD.com is approaching a cup with handle s 85.49 buy point. The stock is about 3% away from the new entry after Tuesday s 2% advance.  According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, ""JD.com s base has morphed into a cup with handle. It is a half position on Leaderboard.

IBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis  Tesla Stock  Tesla stock continues to search for support around its 50-day moving average line. Shares fell as much as 4% early Wednesday after Tuesday s 1.05% gain. Shares are about 15% off their 52-week high, as they form a new base with a 502.59 buy point. The stock is currently trying to find support at its 50-day moving average line.  According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, ""The new base is later stage, following advances from cup-with-handle bases and a high, tight flag that also counted as a base. So, the latest pattern has higher risk.""  Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Salesforce  Among the top Dow Jones stocks, Apple fell 3% Wednesday, on pace to snap a two-day win streak. Shares are looking to regain their 50-day moving average line. Meanwhile, the stock is forming the right side of a new cup-with-handle base, showing a 125.49 buy point, according to MarketSmith chart analysis.

11,2020-10-28,10:13:00,TSLA,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/28/jdcom-is-beating-amazon-and-tesla-to-this-key-tech/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,JD.com Is Beating Amazon and Tesla to This Key Tech Milestone,"JD.com , China s biggest direct online retailer, is set to become the first company in the world to deploy an autonomous delivery vehicle program at scale. The company says it s operating an autonomous delivery robot project in Changshu, Jiangsu province, China, and plans to have 100 autonomous delivery robots in operation in the city by year s end.  JD, which is sometimes referred to as the Amazon  of China, runs its own fulfillment network and third-party marketplace in China, in addition to direct online sales. But the comparison with Amazon often understates the advances the Chinese company has made in areas like fulfillment, grocery sales, and automation, where JD has been consistently ahead of Amazon.  In 2017, JD opened a fully automated warehouse in Shanghai that requires just four workers but ships 200,000 packages a day. Now, the company has raised the bar again in automation, setting up the world s first Level 4 autonomous vehicle network.  The next level  At its Global Smart Supply Chain Summit earlier this month, JD announced that it would have a network of 100 Level 4 delivery vehicles operating in Changshu by the end of the year. The company first put this self-driving vehicle on the road in Wuhan in February to help facilitate contactless delivery to hospitals and residences. JD s autonomous vehicle in Wuhan logged nearly 4,000 miles and delivered more than 13,000 packages in a 107-day deployment, and the company says the technology is now ready to be scaled. The company developed the core of its autonomous driving system in-house, and the current robot is the result of several iterations after it first deployed an autonomous delivery vehicle in 2016.  Level 4 automation is generally defined as self-driving without a driver, but only within a specific mapped area, known as geofencing. The reliance on geofencing makes package deliveries in a city an ideal application for Level 4 technology. Other conditions, like severe weather, can also limit Level 4 autonomous vehicles.  JD s autonomous vehicles drive themselves from destination to destination and notify customers with texts and phone calls that include a verification code to ensure packages are given to the proper recipient. Delivery demand in China has boomed during the pandemic, as China s equivalent to the postal service reportedly delivered more than 60 billion packages year-to-date through Oct. 18. According to the company, JD s robots can both alleviate capacity concerns and assist human couriers.  JD expects to have more than 100,000 automated delivery robots on the road within five years, making them a key part of its logistics infrastructure. JD Logistics CEO Zhenwui Wang said: ""We will continue to increase the investment in logistics technology and we will also make logistics technologies available to the general public, facilitating social infrastructure upgrades.""  Endless possibilities  It s easy to see the direct benefits of the automated delivery vehicles. They can help JD save on labor costs and expand capacity, especially as such vehicles could be operated 24 hours a day. The company also says that their power consumption is just 10% of the industry average, or the equivalent of a standard light bulb.  Being able to deploy a network of the vehicles should also make JD even more appealing as a third-party logistics provider, potentially allowing it to charge lower prices. Or it could license the technology, as Wang alluded to in the quotation above. Third-party logistics is already one of the company s fastest-growing businesses, as the segment saw 54% revenue growth through the first half of 2020, to $2.2 billion.  It s also notable that JD is the first company to roll out a scalable network of Level 4 vehicles, beating Amazon, which recently acquired AV tech company Zoox, known for developing robotaxi technology, and agreed to buy 100,000 electric vehicles from Rivian. Tesla , meanwhile, has long promised to roll out or enable a fleet of ""robotaxis,"" but has yet to do so, though it just introduced its full-self-driving beta, which is currently meant to be used with driver supervision. Its vehicles offer a number of self-driving features under its ""autopilot,"" generally considered to be between Level 2 and Level 3.  Despite JD s technology advances, investors continue to underestimate the potential of the stock. JD.com is also at the forefront in areas like drone delivery, further boosting its logistics capabilities. The Chinese tech stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 36 based on next year s expected earnings, barely more expensive than the S&P 500 and much cheaper than Amazon and Tesla.  Considering its momentum coming out of the pandemic, logistics prowess, growth potential in multiple areas, and its technological innovations, JD stock looks poised for serious long-term gains."

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, AT&T Inc. T, Apple Inc. AAPL and Oracle Corporation ORCL.
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft, Tesla and AT&T. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
Microsoft shares have outperformed the S&P 500 in the year-to-date period (+33.7% vs. +5.8%) on the back of continued momentum in Azure, impressive Teams user growth triggered by coronavirus crisis led work-from-home, the online learning wave and tele healthcare trends.
Solid uptake of Surface devices and Xbox Game Pass aided growth. The company is gaining from growing user base of its different applications including Office 365 commercial, and Dynamics. Also, it is well poised to expand the total addressable market through acquisitions of GitHub and ZeniMax Media.
The company has positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. However, macroeconomic weakness in job market and lower spend on advertising due to coronavirus pandemic are likely to weigh on LinkedIn and Search revenues. Also, delays in consulting business are anticipated to limit growth.

Shares of Tesla have literally been on fire lately, up +551.4% over the past year against the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry’s rise of +162.9%. The Zacks analyst believes that Tesla has a first-mover advantage in the EV space with high range vehicles, superior technology, and software edge.
Robust Model 3 demand, ramp up of Model Y production, Shanghai Gigafactory prospects, amazing line-up of upcoming products and aggressive expansion efforts bode well for the firm. However, high R&D, SG&A costs and massive capex may clip the margins.
Tesla is investing heavily to boost production capacity and sales as well as build gigafactories in Berlin and Austin, which are likely to strain its near-term prospects. Waning margins for Model S/X is another concern. Thus, investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point.

AT&T shares have lost -11.7% over the past six months against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s rise of +4.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that AT&T is well placed to benefit from the streaming services of its newly launched HBO Max and nationwide 5G deployment.
AT&T reported relatively healthy third-quarter 2020 results with solid subscriber growth backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position driven by a diligent execution of operational plans. While adjusted earnings marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues beat the same despite coronavirus hitting top-line growth.
However, AT&T is witnessing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers, legacy services and wireline division. Continued cord-cutting remains a challenge as consumers cancel pay TV packages for cheaper streaming options. As it tries to woo customers with discounts, freebies and cash credits, margins tend to fall. Spectrum crunch in a saturated wireless market is another concern.

Consumer Reports engineers compared the systems based on features including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance. The group ranked Super Cruise as the best option, in part because it deploys a small camera facing the driver s eyes to assess whether the driver is paying attention, an important factor as consumers become more comfortable with self-driving features and could pay less attention to the road.  ""Even with new systems from many different automakers, Super Cruise still comes out on top due to the infrared camera ensuring the driver s eyes are looking toward the roadway,"" Consumer Reports  Kelly Funkhouser said in a summary of the findings released Wednesday.  Tesla s Autopilot got high marks for its capabilities and performance, but was among the lowest ranked in terms of keeping the driver engaged. Super Cruise finished second behind Autopilot in terms of performance and tops in driver engagement, giving it the best overall score.  The evaluation also serves as a reminder of how fast these driver assistance systems are becoming mainstream. Consumer Reports evaluated 17 automaker systems for this year s rankings, up from just four in 2018."

As Electrek reports, the EPA has released MPGe (miles per gallon of gas equivalent) ratings showing the 2021 Model 3, X and Y variants topping the regulator’s electric car efficiency charts. The Model 3 Long Range AWD was the frontrunner, achieving 134MPGe or 25kWh per 100 miles, but other Tesla cars dominate the rankings — you don’t see an EV from another manufacturer until the fifth-place Mini Cooper SE at 108MPGe.  The only other two non-Teslas in the top 10 are the eighth-place Polestar 2 (92MPGe) and its Volvo stablemate, the tenth-place XC40 EV (79MPGe). Tesla would have kept the top spot without the refresh, mind you, as the 2020 Model 3 Long Range still managed 121MPGe."

Stock Market Rally: What To Do Next  An uptrend under pressure means investors need to be much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash.  Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good. The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co s <GM.N> Super Cruise once again edged Tesla s <TSLA.O> Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.
A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.
Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems  abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.
In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.
In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co s <F.N> Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.
The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.
The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.
In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road."

18,2020-10-28,05:18:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-evs-catching-tesla-091832965.html,China EVs Are Catching Up With Tesla,"Beijing has massive ambitions for electric vehicles (EV), and it seeks 25% of all car sales in the country to be EVs by 2025, Financial Times reports.
In 2019, China sold 1.2 million EVs, accounting for more than half of global sales. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects new EV sales to reach 1.1 million by the year-end despite the pandemic, Reuters reports.
According to FT, China can leverage its vast scale advantages to make the first EV that can compete with traditional cars on price and tap the international market, which is ready due to growing worries about climate change.
The EV industry in China is at a critical juncture. The price of EV batteries is set to drop below $100 per kWh by 2023, down from the current $160.
Ev batteries account for a significant portion of the overall car s cost, and the price point below $100 is a cost parity with internal combustion engine cars.
Market Leader: Tesla Inc s (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3 is the leader in China with sales of 70,951 units in 2020 through August, accounting for 13% of the overall EV sales. However, the Wuling HongGuang Mini EV clocked sale of 9,150 units in August, its second full month of sales.
The boxy EV sees huge sales numbers because it comes at $4,200, a fraction of Tesla s $42,691 price tag for Model 3, FT reports.
The HonGuang Mini EV is a joint-venture product between General Motors Company (NYSE: GM),  SAIC Motor, and Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co Ltd.
Nio Inc s (NYSE: NIO) ES6 EV sold 2,840 units in August and 17,161 units in the year through August.
Valuation: Observers call the valuation of Chinese EV companies overcooked. The three US-listed Chinese EV start-ups Nio,  Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ: LI), and Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) are valued at $35.4 billion, $15.9 billion, and $14.4 billion respectively, despite all of them making sizeable losses, FT reports.
EV makers and component suppliers that are profitable are trading at lofty valuations. The Hong Kong-listed EV and traditional carmaker BYD is trading at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 245, while the EV battery maker CATL is has a trailing 12-month PE of 117.5.
PE valuations are high but still lower than Tesla s PE of 1,045.8, according to Hong Kong-based East Capital fund partner Karine Hirn.
When mass-market is reached, China will benefit due to supply chain and scaling advantages, said Hirn.

* INSG nickel market balances: https://tmsnrt.rs/3jw7CXW
By Andy Home
LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price last week touched a year-to-date high of $16,135 per tonne.
Nickel bulls would love to believe this is all about rising usage in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The EV story has generated a tangible buzz in the nickel market over the last two years with Tesla s Elon Musk recently fanning the flames with his call for more mines to meet demand for electrification.
However, the reality is that the recent rally is much more about that most traditional of price drivers, namely the supply of nickel ore to China s giant stainless steel sector.
Such old-school dynamics are going to push the global market into a period of over-supply this year and next, according to the latest forecasts from the International Nickel Study Group (INSG).
The EV narrative, for now at least, is stuck in the slow lane.
ALL ABOUT ORE
The key metric to understanding the recent nickel price rally is the cost of nickel ore, according to analysts at Citi.
The Philippines has emerged as the main supplier of raw material to China s nickel pig iron (NPI) producers since Indonesia banned exports at the start of this year.
The price of medium-grade Philippine ore has doubled over the course of this year to a current $74 per tonne, according to Chinese research house Custeel.
That in turn feeds directly into higher costs for the NPI producers that supply China s stainless steel mills.
The Indonesian ore ban is reaching ""its climax"" with Chinese stocks falling to ""critical levels"" and the Philippines heading into the monsoon season, which limits mining activity, Citi said.
The bank has a ""bull-case"" price target of $17,000 per tonne in the fourth quarter of this year but ""from these highs we would be ready to flip cautious-bearish.""
That s because China s NPI production is declining as the supply chain migrates to Indonesia, which implemented its ore ban to force miners to upgrade to value-added products such as NPI.
This year ""likely marks the last year when China will produce more NPI than Indonesia,"" agrees JPMorgan.
The transition will see flows of Indonesian NPI become the dominant trade for Chinese stainless production.
Philippine ore prices will likely revert back to historical norms of around $35 per tonne which ""will depress costs of marginal Chinese NPI smelters to around $13,000/t, thus removing the cost support for spot nickel prices,"" JPMorgan said. (""Metals Weekly"", Oct. 26 2020)
SURPLUS AHEAD
Such traditional nickel price drivers, particularly the strength of global stainless steel output, will dominate the market for a while yet.
Global output of stainless steel fell by 9.4% in the first half of this year and will fall over the year as a whole despite a rebound in China, the INSG said.
Next year should be a year of recovery but by how much is very uncertain outside of China, where the consensus is for this year s V-shaped recovery to level out.
Global nickel production, by contrast, has been relatively unscathed by the lockdowns that have hit other industrial metals and will grow strongly next year as Indonesia s reconfigured nickel production sector ramps up.
The INSG now sees world output of primary metal at 2.436 million tonnes this year, a marginal 40,000-tonne reduction from the Group s last forecast in October 2019. Production growth will accelerate from 2.3% this year to 6.2% next year.
The Group therefore expects the refined nickel market to register supply surpluses of 117,000 tonnes this year and another 68,000 tonnes in 2021.
These will be the first years of excess supply since 2015.
EV SLOW LANE
What then of nickel s EV story?
It seems to be losing some of its traction, according to LME broker Marex Spectron.
Interest in nickel and electric vehicles peaked early in October and ""has reversed noticeably since then"", according to what the company calls its ""Nowcast"", a series of algorithms that trawl the web to monitor around a billion text documents per year for references between specific commodities and market themes.
""This begs the question of whether the recent reversal in EV Market Focus portends a declining interest in the key demand story for the metal,"" Marex said. (""Quantamental Update - Has the focus on EV as a key nickel demand driver peaked?"", Oct. 26, 2020).
This might seem counter-intuitive given all the headlines generated by Musk s call for more nickel mines.
But COVID-19 has laid low the entire automotive sector, even if EV production is bouncing back more strongly than conventional vehicles as governments prioritise ""green"" investment in their recovery plans.
Electric vehicles currently account for less than 5% of total nickel usage and the fear, to quote Macquarie Bank analysts, is the coronavirus will translate into ""two lost years for the electric vehicle market, pushing back the requirements for new nickel supply (...) all the way out to 2025.""
This theme of deferred expectations has been playing out across the battery metals space, witness this week s news that Australian hard-rock lithium miner Altura Mining has entered receivership due to low prices for its spodumene product.
Nickel s role in the EV revolution has also taken something of a dent from Tesla itself, which is using non-nickel batteries in its Model 3 cars in China. The switch to lithium-iron-phosphate batteries reduces costs but also reflects technical enhancements to a product that was regarded as legacy technology just a year ago.
It is becoming clear that battery design is not going to be a binary competition such as the much-cited 1980s battle between Betamax and VHS in video-taping. Rather, multiple technologies will co-exist to feed a differentiated global market for vehicle functionality.
This is not to say that EVs won t be a critical component of the nickel market going forwards, just that the relationship between sales growth and nickel usage may not be as linear as previously thought.
Nickel bulls may have to defer their great EV expectations for a while yet and focus on what is happening in the currently far more significant stainless steel sector. If the INSG is right, it could be a bumpy ride."
20,2020-10-27,20:26:00,TSLA,https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/tesla-stock-amd-jd-com-struggle-with-buy-point/?src=A00220,"AMD, Tesla, JD.com, Inphi Struggle With Early Buy Points, But This Is The Real Problem","In the past several days, AMD stock, Tesla (TSLA) JD.com (JD) and Inphi (IPHI) have already triggered early entry points. But they have all hit resistance and pulled back just as the buy signal flashed.  X  As CAN SLIM investors get started, they should stick to traditional buy points. But as traders get more experienced, they may look for early entries to start or add to positions. A classic ""early entry"" is a downward-sloping trend line in handles. The official buy point is 10 cents above the top of the handle. But stocks often begin taking off before that, as they break the downward trend in the handle. This can be a place to start a position, perhaps filling out the stake at the traditional buy point.  However, in the past couple of weeks, that hasn t work. Tesla stock, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), JD.com and Inphi have all come up to these trend lines and quickly pulled back. That s not a necessarily bad mark on these stocks, but reflects the continued pullback in the market rally. With the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite still in a downtrend for the past two weeks, it s hard for any stocks to make real progress.  Plenty of recent breakouts have quickly failed or roundtripped big gains.  Tesla and JD.com stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AMD and Inphi stock are on the IBD 50.  Tesla Stock  Tesla stock initially tried to break above short-term resistance on Oct. 14, but has since retreated, forming a handle with a 466 buy point. Shares briefly peeked above a downward-sloping trend line on Oct. 22, right after Tesla earnings, but quickly pulled back. In the past few days, TSLA stock has been holding support at the 50-day line, but hitting resistance at their 21-day exponential moving average.  As the MarketSmith chart shows, the relative strength line has been holding near record highs, showing Tesla stock s strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index for much of 2020.  But with the major indexes retreating, Tesla stock hasn t been able to push higher. At this point, investors looking for an early entry should likely wait for TSLA stock to at least clear its Oct. 22 intraday high.  AMD Stock  AMD stock had a handle buy point of 88.82, though by the end of last week the handle was a little too low in the base to be proper. On Monday, shares popped above a downward-sloping trend line, but gave up most of its intraday gains. On Tuesday, AMD earnings crushed views, but shares tumbled as the chipmaker announced a $35 billion deal to buy Xilinx (XLNX). AMD stock fell though its 50-day line.  Moving above Monday s intraday high might offer an early entry. But right now, AMD is in danger of undercutting recent lows.  JD.com Stock  JD.com stock has a cup-with-handle buy point of 85.49. Twice in the past two weeks shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant have come up to a downward-sloping trend line, but haven t quite broken through. JD.com stock has held support at its 21-day line and its RS line is already at a record high.  Getting above the trend line — or perhaps at 84.56, just over the Oct. 21 high — might be a decent early entry just before the official buy point.  Inphi Stock  Inphi stock has a 125.93 cup-with-handle buy point. Twice in the past two weeks, the data-center chip maker popped above its downward-sloping trend line, but reversed lower. On Tuesday, IPHI stock reversed lower again, sinking to just above its 50-day line.  Inphi stock was a leader after the coronavirus crash, but the RS line has trended lower since early August.  Investors might want to wait for shares to break above the official buy point.  Inphi earnings are due Thursday. That could be a catalyst for Inphi stock up or down.  With AMD, Tesla and other leaders, investors might want to wait for the stock market rally to show real strength before trying any early entries, or perhaps any traditional breakouts.  Stocks sold off hard Wednesday morning, with the Nasdaq tumbling below its 50-day moving average, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 sank further below that key level. Tesla fell 2% in late morning trade, undercutting its 50-day line intraday once again. JD.com lost nearly 3%. AMD retreated more than 2% after Tuesday s Xilinx-linked tumble. So did Inphi.

21,2020-10-27,20:01:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-bezos-musk-charging-ahead-000100424.html,"Blackrock, Bezos And Musk Charging Ahead in this $30 Trillion Mega-Trend","A massive $250 billion has poured into ESG index funds since August, making ESG an investing megatrend that’s soared over 733% in just two years and has had over $30 trillion invested globally.This is Big Capital’s new safe haven and some of the largest names in finance and tech from Goldman Sachs, to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are investing heavily.ESG is considered a less risky and increasingly lucrative corner of Wall Street. The multi-trillion-dollar reality is that tech and ESG are now inextricably linked.And they are massively outperforming the market.The holy grail of this new trend, therefore, should be a solid ESG platform combined with an impressive tech ecosystem.And now, there’s a company that’s managed to do just that. Facedrive (TSXV:FD; OTC:FDVRF)—the Canadian tech darling that’s been stealing headlines across multiple sectors. It’s a company that’s grasped the enormity of this megatrend.It knows what Big Capital—like the $7 trillion finance giant BlackRock —wants. It understands that big money is looking for more places to park on the in-demand ESG playing field. And it doesn’t want a limited, one-off opportunity.It wants an entire ecosystem of ESG tech offerings with limitless verticals. That’s why Facedrive, one of the most impressively ambitious innovators to have come out of Canada’s Waterloo ‘Technology Triangle’ (aka the new ‘Silicon Valley’) - has created, launched, and exceptionally branded 6 entire ESG divisions in just one year. It’s been hot on the acquisition trail for months, and its latest grab was a game-changer:Two Huge Disruptors in Two MonthsIn September, Facedrive scooped up Chicago-based Steer, an EV subscription service that aims to upend the $5 trillion global transportation industry, in a deal that includes a $2-million strategic investment by energy giant Exelon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC. 
The pioneer of carbon-offset ride-sharing in Canada, Facedrive—behind the wheel of Steer—plans to completely change the way people view car ownership. 
Anyone who wanted but couldn’t afford an EV before, can now afford an EV ride, with Steer. That means Steer and its heavy-weight owners and backers will be disrupting industry segments on multiple levels. 
Exelon’s  market cap is ~$41 billion ... and it’s not the only huge market-cap company whose radar Facedrive is pinging: There’s also a tie-in to ecommerce king Amazon  ....
Steer is at the crossroads where $25 trillion meets: 
The $5 trillion IT industry
The $12 trillion digital economy
The $8 trillion auto industry
And it’s all boosted by the fastest-growing megatrend of the year—ESG investing. But Steer is just the most recent move by Facedrive, the tech giant’s previous deal was arguably even bigger.In August, Facedrive acquired Tally Technologies, the high-tech major league sports predicting startup founded by NFL superstar Russel Wilson. Tally came out of TraceMe, a celebrity content app founded by Wilson with early-in investors from the biggest tech companies in the world and acquired by Nike last year. And that acquisition turned some of the biggest names in the tech industry into Facedrive shareholders ... because the transaction was a share exchange that saw Facedrive inject $1M in cash in Tally and $2M in Facedrive shares. 
Now, Tally plans to revolutionize major league sports with “gamification” and online fan engagement. 
Gamified for ultimate fan engagement, this major league sports platform will now be free-to-play and predictive. 
That means new revenue potential for major leagues sports, which is exactly why Tally has already been chosen by the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB as the premier tech solution. 
All-Inclusive Tech on the Front Lines of COVID-19
There’s hardly a better “impact” investing element to add to your ESG portfolio than a contact tracing app designed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic with its very own line of wearables ... 
The company’s TraceSCAN contact-tracing technology is positioned to help save the tourism industry, which is facing $1 trillion in losses due to the pandemic and is expected to shed 100 million jobs before the year is out worldwide. 
Aviation giant Air Canada is already on board. 
On October 7th, Air Canada signed a deal with Facedrive Inc. (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) to launch a pilot project for its employees using proprietary TraceSCAN technology. 
TraceSCAN Wearables could help the tourism industry deal with COVID. Facedrive combines complex algorithms in an AI-enabled mobile application with wearable devices built on the industry standard nRF52 Bluetooth chipset.  
That means it can reach those millions of workers around the world, from construction and medical to education and security, who can’t operate with a phone in hand 24/7, as well as the at-risk elderly.  
It’s fully mobile COVID-19 detection on a wristband, in a tag worn around the neck or in a pocket pod. And it intends to get us back to work, and back to fun--safely.  
Air Canada isn’t the only major airline taking the TraceSCAN plunge... The Government of Ontario lent its support to TraceSCAN back in July because it’s the only feasible technology that will help get masses of government employees back to work without spreading COVID-19.And now, talks with other airlines are in motion because the industry is facing more than $84 billion in losses ... so, the news flow is expected to be fast and momentous. 
The Tech Company That Has It AllEven before it acquired Steer with the aim to change the way we view car ownership ...And before it jumped into Tally, the innovative tech that creates major sports revenue verticals for our interactive, engaged future ...Facedrive already had 5 ESG divisions, making it a one-stop-shop for multi-industry tech-driven ESG. From its pioneering carbon-neutral ride-sharing and long-distance carpooling platform, food and pharmacy deliveries and COVID contact-trading to its own celebrity-branded merch marketplace (think: Will Smith’s Bel Air Athletics) and a blockbuster social distancing trivia and social engagement app, Facedrive has the kind of verticals the new big money is looking for. Until now, Facedrive’s ESG platform has been stealing headlines across industries in Canada...But the Steer deal plants it firmly in the United States, where the next big push is about to take place. Big names have already tied into this wide-ranging tech play ... from  energy giant Exelon to Air Canada ...There’s been no faster news flow coming out of the Toronto Stock Exchange than this ...And the next big name to sign on to any one of these tech deals is likely to have serious impact. Some other companies looking to capitalize on the sustainability push:
Facebook (FB) has truly taken the ESG trend to heart. It has dedicated a lot of resources on constructing more sustainable work environments. It s building designs integrate a variety of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all items taken in on-site. Not only that, it also focuses on its workforce, with equal opportunity hiring policies, ample time off, and much more. Facebook is also taking an ingenious approach in its goal to cut back its carbon footprint. Its massive data centers are some of the most efficient on the planet. And it s only beginning. By the end of this year, Facebook intends to have all of its data centers running on 100% green energy. Microsoft (MSFT) is another key tech giant integrating sustainability into its business model. Microsoft is going above and beyond in its carbon emissions promise. It is aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. Not just is the tech giant taking a major role in minimizing its carbon emissions, but it is also at the forefront of a technological wave that is actively helping other companies control their emissions.Microsoft has built many new technologies to assist and assess the impact of different companies on the environment, helping collect data to better comprehend where and how the world can become greener. In addition, Microsoft is creating tools to better control water use and curb the world s growing waste issues.Not to be outdone, Google (GOOGL) is fixated on raising the bar for the smart use of the world s dwindling resources. Like Facebook, Google is developing sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and office environments. It is likewise leveraging artificial intelligence to create a system that will help the world use energy in a more efficient manner. Google is also concentrated on building a sustainable supply chain. It is dedicated to enhancing the lives of everyone linked to its products, from its data centers to truck drivers and beyond. Additionally, it is actively decreasing its ecological impact by working with suppliers to offer them the tools and tech they need to become more energy efficient.NextEra Energy (NEE), the world leader in solar and wind producer, is playing a crucial role in the course towards sustainability. In fact, in 2018, the business was the top capital investor in green energy facilities and the 5th biggest investor across all sectors.In addition to its huge influence on global climate change, it has a plan to invest another $55 billion in American energy facilities in the next 2 years. All while keeping a firm dedication to minimize its reliance on foreign oil. Since 2001, it has detached itself from foreign oil almost entirely, announcing a 98% decline over the past twenty years. Much more enticing, however, is its dedication to developing investor value. Over the past 15 years, investors have seen 945% returns.We can’t talk about ESG without mentioning Tesla .There’s a reason Tesla has performed so well this year. Investors love Elon Musk’s vision. As one of the world’s most innovative car manufacturers, it has single-handedly made electric vehicles cool. Its slick design is beloved across the world. In fact, it’s almost impossible to NOT see a Tesla in cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco.  Though Tesla has received some poor marks for its workplace health and safety due to a few incidents of employees feeling overworked and under-appreciated compared to its peers, Tesla scores very high on pollution prevention and corporate governance.Canadian business are doing their part:
Stars Group Inc  is a world leader in the online and mobile gaming industry. With a focus on maintaining high regulatory standards while simultaneously offering a wide range of products across multiple platforms, Stars has solidified its place among the gaming hierarchy.
In December, Stars Group secured a major partnership with the National Basketball Association in order to use data and league marks across their digital sports betting offerings.Scott Kaufman-Ross, Head of Fantasy & Gaming, NBA explained, ""This dynamic partnership will be another way to create authentic fan engagement with league logos and official NBA betting data, while leveraging Stars  global expertise to further optimize the fan experience.ePlay Digital Inc.  creates technology that helps TV networks, esports teams and leagues and even venues cut through the noise to reach their target audience. The company brings together multiple platforms to create engagement across social media, traditional media, streaming, and more. With a team built from sports, esports, and gaming experts, ePlay knows the video game industry inside and out. That’s why they’ve secured partnerships with companies including Time Warner Cable, ESPN, Sony Pictures, AXS TV, Intel, AXN, Fiat, CBS, Cineplex, and others.Shaw Communications Inc.  is major player in the Canadian telecoms sector. It owns a ton of infrastructure throughout Canada and its cloud services and open-source projects look to address some of the biggest issues that its customers might face before the customers even face them. As online gaming depends on solid internet connections, Shaw will likely become a backdoor benefactor in increased online activity. Telus Corporation  is Canada’s second largest internet provider, serving over 8 million Canadians from coast to coast. Though it’s not producing its own content, it is carving out its own path in the industry thanks to its innovative approach to technology and investments across multiple sectors.Like Shaw, Telus will be another company to watch as gamers, and the general population, turn to their phones and computers for entertainment.

A full transcript follows the video.  This video was recorded on October 22, 2020.  Chris Hill: It s Thursday, October 22nd. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I m Chris Hill, with me today, Mr. Jason Moser. Good to see you my friend.  Jason Moser: Good to see you.  Hill: We ve got -- I said it before, it s my favorite time of year, and it comes four times a year, we got earnings season heating up. We got Chipotle , we got Tesla , we re going to perform an autopsy on Quibi.  Let s start with Tesla, though. Tesla reported a profit in the third quarter that was higher than Wall Street was expecting, and this is the fifth quarter in a row that Tesla has delivered a profit. Stock up about 5% this morning. It was one of those things where the lightbulb went off above my head this morning, Jason. It was like the fifth quarter in a row, profits, earnings... oh, wait! they have a P/E ratio now, I wonder what it is, and it s just shy of 1,100.  Moser: Oh, I mean, I guess the market is just pulling forward some very robust expectations, let s just maybe leave it at that. You know, I don t have a dog in this hunt, so to speak, I don t own Tesla shares, I ve not recommended it, I ve not short it, I enjoy following this business, learning from it and there s some entertainment value there for sure. The core business here is just really so simple, right? I mean, they make cars and they sell them to people. And yet it s such a sideshow to the distractions and the drama with analysts, they re so dead-set on one position or the other. I mean, you go on Twitter, and it s just this back-and-forth that never ends. And honestly, it s like DC, I mean, nobody is going to budge, right?  But to your point, fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. Yeah, we could sit there and argue about how they got to profitability, and I ll note that regulatory credits, I think, are probably a big question that a lot of folks will continue to harp on, how important are they. I think in regard to Tesla s business, regulatory credits are very important, but that shouldn t be a surprise. That s how you incentivize moving an entire society over to a new technology like this that we re so reliant on in transportation.  And so, this year so far, they ve taken advantage of about $1.2 billion in those credits, and that clearly affects profitability, that s good for them. But I don t hold that against them, because they re just playing the hand that they were dealt, they are playing with the rules of the game more or less. If you compare that to last year at this time, they claimed about $460 million in credit. So, clearly a considerable amount more in credits this year than last, and I m sure that s something that we ll continue to see them take advantage of to the extent they can. But I mean, they produced just over 145,000 vehicles, they delivered almost 140,000.  And I think, while Musk certainly loves to aim high, and I think he should, their 500,000 deliveries for the year remains a target. Now, that is a high goal. That s a lofty goal. They need about 180,000 to go. They need about 180,000 this final quarter. Maybe they get there, maybe they don t, but I think the more time goes on, the more we re seeing the market is willing to give this business time to do its thing. And not every business out there can claim that luxury, but you see companies like Amazon, for the longest time, the market really gave Bezos the leash to run with that business and build it. You see the same thing happening here.  So, I m for the business, I love what he s trying to do, I think it s funny to listen to just people go back-and-forth on the valuation and whatnot, but here we are and this is clearly a business that s making a big impact in the world.  Hill: Yeah, there are definitely a couple of analysts, I was watching on CNBC this morning, who are bearish on Tesla. And they re getting kind of worked up. [laughs] It was just one of those things where I felt a little bad for them, I don t know, I mean ...  Moser: And like I said, I don t dive into that discussion because it s just so unproductive. So, I d say the one thing, like, if you look at where they are today in regard to the balance sheet. I mean, they re quarter in, they re cash equivalents jumped from $6 billion to $14.5 billion. Now, remember they had a capital raise here recently; I think they raised around $5 billion. If I had one piece of advice for Elon Musk -- and listen, Chris, I m a dummy, OK, I know that. I mean, he s not asking me for advice, but if I were to give him one piece of advice. You know, like we ve talked before about Tom Gardner s philosophy on your holding period, right? However long you plan to hold a stock, just, boom! Automatically double that, right, double that holding period and you ll benefit from it. I feel like any time he wants to raise money, double it, because it s just clear as day that any lever he wants to pull, he s going to be able to raise that money without too much trouble. And particularly where the stock is today, I mean, if he gets to a point where he needs to raise more capital, and he probably will, I mean, he sees the energy business ultimately being as large as the vehicle business one day, and that s going to require a lot of investment too. Yeah, anytime you re ready to raise some money, just go ahead and double it. I think that would be a nice rule of thumb.  Hill: Third quarter profits and revenue for Chipotle came in higher than expected. Same-store sales were north of 8%, and Chipotle s digital sales tripled year-over-year. And despite all that, shares down more than 5%. What is going on here, did Brian Niccol say something on the call?  Moser: [laughs] No, no, no, no. I think there are a couple of things that are probably coming into play here. No. 1, I think it s probably selling a little bit on valuation, in that, the stock is trading for over 120X full-year earnings estimates. I mean, this is still a burrito company basically at the end of the day. So, you know, +120X, that s a pretty expensive burrito, so to speak. So, I think there s probably a little bit of selling on the valuation side of it, but there s also some concern there. And fair concern, I think, in the delivery, and we ll talk about that in a minute. But I do think it s just amazing.  I was thinking about this yesterday, the Chipotle story, it s amazing to watch here over the last several years, because they went from a restaurant that really couldn t stop from getting people sick to now being, like, one of the best operators in the entire space during a pandemic where a lot of people are getting sick. So, just hats off to Brian Niccol, the CEO. I think he s just done such a good job with this business since he took over, and it goes to show you the value in hiring folks with a lot of industry expertise like he has coming over from Taco Bell. So, for what it s worth, I think they made a great call on the CEO side.  But when you start looking at the numbers, I mean, it really does feel like Chipotle is turning into Domino s, it s really interesting to see. They have over 17 million loyalty program members now versus just 7 million a year ago. And that s all thanks, really, to a very strong app. And if you looked [laughs] on the call, as I did, the word ""delivery"" was mentioned 45 times on yesterday s earnings call. A year ago, it was mentioned six times. And I think that is potentially a source of some market concern as well, because when you look at delivery, the digital sales numbers were really impressive, they grew over 200%. They represented close to 50% of sales. About half of digital was delivery, and the concern there, and they note this. And so, I want to read this exactly as they noted.  But here s the crux of it, they say the amount that we remit to our delivery partner for sale through our app and website is higher than what we collect from customers and is included in other operating costs. So, delivery is something that is, yeah, it s driving the topline maybe a little bit, but it s also something tampering profitability. And they re going to have to figure out a way to square that at some point, but for now, they re doing a really good job in the face of what is a very difficult restaurant space, utilizing that delivery lever, really growing that part of the business. I don t hold that against them, I understand maybe a little bit of the concern in the near-term, but I think that when you look at all of these numbers put together, you still have to be very bullish on this company s future.  Hill: We ve talked before about the opportunity they have in terms of expansion, to grow their footprint. Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, was talking this morning about corporate travel and how he thinks that s going to take 10 years for corporate travel to fully recover for the airline industry. David Chang, the restaurateur and chef was tweeting this morning about how the restaurant industry is tied to corporate business. And you know, putting those two together and, in particular, David Chang s comments, it really does seem like a longer opportunity for that type of investment for Chipotle to grow its footprint.  Moser: Yeah. I absolutely agree. I mean, I think they ve done a very good job of not trying to expand too quickly, that can be one of the dangers of franchising is that it gives you the opportunity to grow really quickly, but sometimes that can be a little bit of an anchor on you if times are a little tougher. And so, they opened 44 new restaurants during the quarter, and closed only three. They have just over 2,700 stores today, and most of them are all open.  Since sales really hit their low in March, they ve been able to retain, they said, 80% to 85% of the digital sales gains, while recovering about 50% to 55% of their in-store sales. So, again, I think that when you see how they re slowly and methodically growing that footprint and then they re also making sure that they utilize that physical store footprint for more than just the in-store dining experience or even picking up for that matter, again, I go back to Domino s, and really one of the things that Domino s really done so well through the years is utilizing that physical footprint to essentially offer two different businesses, right, it s a pickup and it s a delivery. And I think that Chipotle is really starting to exploit that as well.  And if you do it right, if you do it well, it can be really, really valuable over many years. And Domino s investors, you know what I m talking about. If you held on that [laughs] stock for the last +10 years, you are just loving life. Now, I m not saying Chipotle will be Domino s, it s pizza versus burritos, and probably a little bit of a different market opportunity there, but I think that Chipotle is going to continue to be able to focus on the core Mexican food business for some time to come. And at 2,700 stores today, you know, they re going to keep on opening up 100 new stores a year here-and-there for the foreseeable future. And so, for investors, you have to love that, because now we re going to see two different drivers of sales from not only the store itself, but also the delivery model that they ll perfect that, they ll get it down, and it ll become something that s a bit more profitable and meaningful to the bottom-line, it s just going to take a little time.  Hill: Six months after its launch in April, Quibi, the short-video streaming service, is being shut down due to a complete lack of interest. The company was started all the way back in August of 2018 by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman. They raised $1.75 billion and then proceeded to light that money on fire. Where do you want to begin with this guy, because one thought I had, and we were chatting a little bit about this yesterday, is that capitalism works. Like, among other things, this is an example of capitalism working. They built this thing, they spent a lot of money to do it, they put it out there, and everyone collected and said ""no.""  Moser: Yeah, I mean, you re absolutely right. This is a great example of capitalism working. And there are a lot of different ways to go with this. And I don t want to make light of the fact that people are losing their jobs from this, though, I will say that even for the most glass half full person, jumping on board with this entity, you had to probably feel like the chances of success were going to be lower than 50%, I would have assumed, but it seemed like it was a little bit obvious all of us in the analyst community. But it was amazing to me, I read in one of the articles that during a video call with employees, Katzenberg actually suggested that staffers listen to the song Get Back Up Again from the Trolls film to buoy their spirits. I mean, it s like he s still talking to his own booking, [laughs] he s getting ready to lay a bunch of people off is what it sounded like. But it was very odd, like, I don t know, I feel like, it just didn t seem to me to be as sympathetic as probably it could have been.  But we talked about this a few shows ago, right, a few weeks back, where I don t think anyone, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, really knew what Quibi was supposed to be. I mean, is it social, is it streaming, is it social streaming? I mean, there were already all sorts of competitors out there in that space to some extent. And so, sometimes, in investing, like we say, sometimes investing, you just have to be able to call the mistake, admit it, move on, as opposed to just keeping on burning money. And it sounds like in this case, I mean, they burned through their capital, and that was basically that. And I think the writing is on the wall. It sounded like a lot of Hollywood was doubtful to begin with, interestingly enough, they didn t have a problem selling [laughs] content, they re like, hey, sure, we ll sell it to you, but we don t think you re going to succeed.  So, listen, when you jump into a crowded space like this, and video streaming is a crowded space, obviously, you need to differentiate yourself, you need to innovate, do something different, and it just didn t seem like they did that, like, at all. And you know, speaking of Seinfeld, it reminded me of that reservation s episode of Seinfeld, it all comes back to Seinfeld, Chris. But it s like, you say you know how to get in there, differentiate or innovate, but you don t actually know how to do it. Saying it doesn t mean that you re doing it. And it didn t feel like they really had come to that realization until it was just way too late.  Hill: So, one of the thoughts I ve had about all this is, I feel like we need to come up with a new word to replace the word ""unicorn"" as it is used in the world of investing. And for those unfamiliar, a unicorn is a private company that reaches a private market valuation of $1 billion. And I was thinking about something Emily Flippen said on the show a few weeks back where she made the comment like, the world is only getting bigger, we re only going to have more companies with $1 trillion market caps in the future, not fewer. And so, as things continue, I think we need to come up with a different -- because, you know, that was part of it, that s like, oh! look at this company, they ve raised nearly $2 billion, you know? What would this be worth in the open market? That s like, well, it turns out zero. So, yeah ...  Moser: Yeah, I look at some of these capital raises with some of these businesses, and it s astounding the money that some of these businesses raise. And it s just astounding, I mean, it s breathtaking, [laughs] like you said. Look at Robinhood, for example. With all of the trouble and issues that they continue to have, I don t know why anybody who s getting started investing today, why would you use Robinhood, because every other platform could basically match what they re doing for the most part and it s going to be a more robust and, frankly, trustworthy platform. And yet, this business continues to raise billions and billions of dollars, and it s garnered something like +$10 billion market valuation. Now, that to me seems really absurd, but it just goes to show, man, there are some very deep pockets when it comes to these VC interests and investors who aren t necessarily participating in the public markets. And I think the thing is, in most cases it s really all about hitting a couple of homeruns as opposed to trying to get, like, 60% of your picks right. I think most people know that they re not going to be getting 60% of those picks right, it s really just about finding a couple of grand slams that can make a big impact.  Hill: Yeah. I mean, the unicorn is an incredibly rare creature, and private market valuations of $1 billion are becoming increasingly less rare. I ll tell you what is really a unicorn, it s something like Quibi, something that from day one, we all sort of looked at and we re like, I don t think that s going to work, and then every step along the way, like, yeah, no, it s still not working. The launch isn t going well, they re burning cash, like, oh, my God! They re exploring strategic alternatives. Oh, they re dead.  Like, I can t think of another time when, you know, there was a business -- you know, maybe Pets.com back in the day, but ...  Moser: [laughs] It feels like there are always going to be those examples. That s why this job is so fun, because we get to see this stuff every day. I mean, the market, at the end of the day, we said it, it s just like a really big disagreement. And both parties think they re right for whatever reasons, and you have to figure out a way to reconcile that and choose a side. I think we chose ours on this one very early on.  Hill: Yeah, if only we had a chance to short it. All right. We ll wrap up there. Jason, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.  Moser: Yep, thank you.  Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.  That s going to do it for this edition of MarketFoolery. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd, I m Chris Hill, thanks for listening, we ll see you on Monday."
23,2020-10-27,19:02:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercedes-bets-evolution-tesla-touts-230258319.html,Mercedes bets on evolution as Tesla touts revolution in automated driving,"By Edward Taylor
IMMENDINGEN, Germany (Reuters) - As Tesla touts the cutting-edge nature of its new Full Self Driving software, rival Mercedes-Benz says it has developed a similar system but stops short of allowing members of the public to take it on urban roads.
The Germans, pioneers in developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), are taking a step-by-step approach to releasing new technology, waiting for their own engineers, rather than the general public, to validate their system.
Both approaches - one conservative and one radical in nature - are designed to push highly automated driving on to public roads, a step that could massively reduce accidents, since computers have faster accident-avoidance reflexes than humans.
Advanced driver assistance systems can provide steering, braking and acceleration support under limited circumstances, generally on highways. Carmakers have refrained from relying on their technology to let cars navigate urban inner-city traffic.
Tesla broke this tradition last week when it released its FSD software which allows its computer-powered cars to practise their reflexes in inner-city traffic situations, with a warning that its cars ""May Do the Wrong Thing at the Worst Time.""
Mercedes does not allow members of the public to test still-experimental systems. Its engineers need to pass an eligibility exam to become test drivers, and another one for testing automated driving systems, the carmaker said.
Rather than force their customers to put their trust in processors, software and the ability of machines to learn over time, the Germans want their cars to be validated by engineers so that they remain predictable for owners.
""We do not want blind trust. We want informed trust in the car. The customer needs to know exactly what the car can and cannot do,"" a Mercedes spokesman told Reuters on the sidelines of the carmaker s test track in Immendingen, Germany.
""The worst thing would be if the car gets into a complex situation and there was ambiguity over whether the car is in control or not,"" he said.
This is why the Stuttgart-based carmaker, owned by Daimler AG, is emphasising its decades-old experience of automated driver assistance systems as it seeks to gain global regulatory approval for its own Drive Pilot system which boasts level 3 automation.
Level 3 means the driver can legally take their eyes off the wheel and the company, Daimler in this case, would have to assume insurance liability, depending on the jurisdiction.
The new Tesla system forces customers to take responsibility for any crash.
 LOGICAL NEXT STEP 
Mercedes-Benz started using camera-based systems in 2009, offering traffic-light recognition and lane-keeping assistance systems, switching to stereo cameras in 2013, to add depth of field and pedestrian recognition for emergency braking functions.
It was on a joint development project between the Tesla Model S and the Mercedes-Benz electric B-Class that Tesla s CEO, Elon Musk, learned about camera and radar-based assistance systems, senior engineers familiar with the project told Reuters.
Mercedes plans to launch Drive Pilot next year and is pitching it as an evolution of its Distronic system, launched in 2013, which uses cameras and radar to keep cars in lane and at a distance to the car in front.
Drive Pilot will add a new sensor: Lidar, to cross-reference data gathered by radar, ultrasonic sensors, high-definition mapping, radar and cameras.
""It is a paradigm change from Distronic, but it is a strategic evolution. For us this is the logical next step and it is not shooting for the moon,"" said Michael Decker, manager of automated driving at Mercedes-Benz Cars, while standing on the sidelines of the company s testing campus in Immendingen, where the Mercedes hones autonomous driving systems.
Decker, behind the wheel of the new S-Class, drives the car on to a stretch of road mocked up to replicate an autobahn and selects Drive Pilot. The car glides seamlessly, providing gentle braking and steering inputs to keep its place in moving traffic.
""I spend most of my time dealing with edge cases, those special situations that we need to have under control,"" he said. The Mercedes Drive Pilot will only work at up to 60 kilometers an hour, and reach higher speeds once the legal framework allows.
It will function only on highways in Germany from mid-next year onward, if a new law is passed.
""If the car crosses the border into France, it will disengage, because we use high-definition mapping as one of our validation systems, and France has not created the legal framework for allowing this system to operate,"" Decker said.
Although Mercedes engineers are aware of Tesla s more aggressive approach to marketing their systems, they appear unruffled.

On the one hand, there is the fear of missing out on more returns in the equity market. On the other, is elevated anxiety about the outcome and aftermath of the election and what that will do to their portfolios. Those are among the key takeaways from our recent survey of Investopedia readers, the fifth we have conducted since before the coronavirus was named a global pandemic.  Caught in the Neutral Zone  While our readers are slightly less bullish than they were in August, they are also slightly less bearish than they were in the summer. Since then, economies have opened up and growth is strong across most industries – although the labor market remains compromised – yet the virus is still very present in everyday life. Equity markets have trudged higher after rebounding out of the fastest bear market in history, and that has caused some concerns about stretched valuations in some stocks and sectors.  The Election is the Overhang  The upcoming election remains the dominant concern among our readers. While they are split on who they think will win the election, they remain concerned about the impact it will have on their portfolios. They are also concerned about what will happen in the aftermath of the election and whether it will be contested and peaceful.  Staying the Course  Despite their worries, only one quarter of our survey respondents, who range in age and income across the U.S., are making changes to their portfolios. Most are sticking with the stocks and strategies that have carried them through this tumultuous year. Their favorite stocks (listed below) show that they have chosen wisely and safely.  Millennials are significantly more likely than boomers to say they re making big changes to their investments based on recent market events (25% vs 15). Among those making changes, Millennials are more likely to be investing more (45% of Millennials responding to the market say they re investing more money vs 18% of Boomers). They re also going riskier. 31% of Millennials making changes say they re moving into riskier investments vs 13% of Boomers).  Too Far, Too Fast?  62% of our survey respondents, regardless of age, think the stock market has become overvalued. 71% believe that the economy and the stock market are disconnected and 54% anticipate it could experience another significant drop in the next three months. The reasons for that are as described: The election, its aftermath, and the possibility of another economic shutdown.  They are also slightly concerned about President Trump’s use of social media as a communications tool and its impact on the stock market, as well as his health and the health of his administration. We fielded the survey just as the president tested positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently hospitalized.  Investors Keep the Faith in Their Favorite Stocks  Our readers have proven to be faithful investors when it comes to their portfolios. The top 10 holdings have remained fairly consistent throughout the pandemic, although there is variation among the different age groups of our readers. But the top three holdings – Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) – are also among the most widely held stocks in index funds, ETFs, hedge funds, endowments, and among retail investors.  Millennials are even more likely to favor IT (49% vs 41% among Boomers) and Boomers are even more likely to favor healthcare (19% vs 12% millennials).  Older investors have held onto their favorite dividend paying stocks like Bank of America (BAC) and Verizon (VZ), as well as traditional media companies like Disney (DIS). Tesla (TSLA) investors are nothing if not loyal and they have stuck with the electric car maker through many peaks and valleys, although 2020 has mostly been peaks.  What’s Next?  The next few months are a big question mark for investors. The election is the obvious elephant in the room, but beyond that, the resurgence of the virus and another potential lockdown, concerns about social unrest, and the widening disconnect between the capital markets and the economy will cloud the horizon. Individual investors, like our readers, have different time horizons and goals for investing than institutional investors. They can mostly afford to be patient until the smoke clears on any one or all of those issues. Until then, expect them to stay in the neutral zone."

26,2020-10-27,15:27:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorn-says-tech-stocks-174728557.html,David Einhorn Says Tech Stocks Are in an Enormous Bubble,"(Bloomberg) -- Investor David Einhorn said technology stocks are in an “enormous” bubble and he has added a set of short wagers to profit from it.
“The question at hand is where are we in the psychology of this bubble?” the head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital wrote in an Oct. 27 note, seen by Bloomberg. “Our working hypothesis, which might be disproven, is that September 2, 2020 was the top and the bubble has already popped. If so, investor sentiment is in the process of shifting from greed to complacency.”
Tech stocks have driven the market’s rally this year. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 33% since Jan. 1, led by gains in Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Tesla Inc. By contrast, the S&P 500 has risen 5.3%.
As signs of a bubble, Einhorn points to a mania in IPOs, a huge market concentration in a small group of stocks or a single sector, extraordinary valuations and “incredible” trading volumes in speculative instruments.
As a result, Greenlight has adjusted the portfolio of companies its wagering against by adding a fresh so-called bubble basket of mostly “second-tier companies and recent IPOs trading at remarkable valuations,” he wrote. Einhorn has long held what he calls a bubble basket of short wagers which have included tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc.
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.
This isn’t the first time Einhorn has flagged a tech bubble. In early 2016, he “prematurely identified what we thought was a bubble,” he wrote in the letter.
It’s been a difficult road for Greenlight recently. The fund is down 16.1% through September, and has been trying to recoup losses that began in 2015. As of Jan. 1, the firm managed $2.6 billion, down from a peak of $12 billion.
Other highlights from the letter:
The coming election may rank “among the most perilous times, absent war, in modern American history.” A “tempest” of troubles related to the Covid pandemic -- including inequities, violence and calls for social change -- could explode after the election, no matter which side wins.The fund started “medium-sized” long positions in information technology company Synnex Corp., Austrian sensor maker AMS AG, and ATM-manufacturer NCR Corp.While a few Greenlight employees are working from the firm’s New York offices, which have been open since late summer, most of the staff continues to work from home, he said.

The company also produces solar panels and batteries, designs computer chips, and writes self-driving software.
Now the company is looking to help lower electric rates for customers with a new Energy Plan in the United Kingdom.
In a report covered on Teslarati, it looks like Tesla is going to work with local company Octopus Energy to help distribute its new energy plan. Tesla s new energy plan is going to offer a rate of 8p(pence)/kWh to Tesla vehicle owners and 11p/kWh for non-owners. This can be almost 50% lower than the average rate of 14.40p/kWh in the UK, although rates vary by location.
The energy plan will work with Tesla s solar products including solar panels and Powerwall. Tesla lists benefits such as helping the environment, reducing energy bills, and protection from power outages.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PACCAR Inc PCAR, Genuine Parts Company GPC, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, General Motors Company GM and Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG.
Last week, the third-quarter earnings season for the auto sector kicked off. So far this earnings season, just two S&P stocks from the auto sector, namely PACCAR and Genuine Parts, came up with quarterly numbers. Various other auto firms including the red-hot electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla, auto retailers namely Lithia Motors, Penske Automotive and AutoNation. Encouragingly, all the above-mentioned companies managed to deliver earnings beat. 
Meanwhile, U.S. auto giant General Motors grabbed limelight as it continues to step up its EV game. The firm announced plans to spend $2 billion to convert the Tennessee assembly plant to manufacture green vehicles. It also unveiled the first look of 2022 GMC Hummer EV sport utility truck. On the contrary, Harley-Davidson recalled more than 1,000 LiveWire bikes in the United States.
(Read the Last Auto Stock Roundup here).
1. Tesla reported stellar results for third-quarter 2020, posting profit for the fifth consecutive quarter. The company reported earnings of 76 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago earnings of 37 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $8,771 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $8,225 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 39%.
Tesla has maintained the target of 500K deliveries for full-year 2020. Importantly, the firm generated free cash flow of $1,395 million during the quarter. The metric compared favorably with $418 million and $371 million recorded in the prior quarter and the year-ago period, respectively. (Tesla Q3 Earnings Beat,  20 Delivery Target Intact)
2. General Motors recently announced the decision to invest $2 billion in its Spring Hill, TN assembly plant. This will facilitate the transition of the assembly plant to become the company’s third vehicle production facility for manufacturing electric vehicles (EV).Its two existing EV manufacturing plants are Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, MI, and Orion Assembly in Orion Township, MI.
The new luxury Cadillac LYRIQ will be the first EV to be manufactured at Spring Hill, along with the conventional combustion engine-powered Cadillac XT6 and XT5 luxury SUV crossovers, making the plant at Spring Hill not 100% electric, unlike the Factory Zero and Orion Assembly plants.

* INSG nickel market balances: https://tmsnrt.rs/3jw7CXW
By Andy Home
LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price last week touched a year-to-date high of $16,135 per tonne.
Nickel bulls would love to believe this is all about rising usage in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The EV story has generated a tangible buzz in the nickel market over the last two years with Tesla s Elon Musk recently fanning the flames with his call for more mines to meet demand for electrification.
However, the reality is that the recent rally is much more about that most traditional of price drivers, namely the supply of nickel ore to China s giant stainless steel sector.
Such old-school dynamics are going to push the global market into a period of over-supply this year and next, according to the latest forecasts from the International Nickel Study Group (INSG).
The EV narrative, for now at least, is stuck in the slow lane.
ALL ABOUT ORE
The key metric to understanding the recent nickel price rally is the cost of nickel ore, according to analysts at Citi.
The Philippines has emerged as the main supplier of raw material to China s nickel pig iron (NPI) producers since Indonesia banned exports at the start of this year.
The price of medium-grade Philippine ore has doubled over the course of this year to a current $74 per tonne, according to Chinese research house Custeel.
That in turn feeds directly into higher costs for the NPI producers that supply China s stainless steel mills.
The Indonesian ore ban is reaching ""its climax"" with Chinese stocks falling to ""critical levels"" and the Philippines heading into the monsoon season, which limits mining activity, Citi said.
The bank has a ""bull-case"" price target of $17,000 per tonne in the fourth quarter of this year but ""from these highs we would be ready to flip cautious-bearish.""
That s because China s NPI production is declining as the supply chain migrates to Indonesia, which implemented its ore ban to force miners to upgrade to value-added products such as NPI.
This year ""likely marks the last year when China will produce more NPI than Indonesia,"" agrees JPMorgan.
The transition will see flows of Indonesian NPI become the dominant trade for Chinese stainless production.
Philippine ore prices will likely revert back to historical norms of around $35 per tonne which ""will depress costs of marginal Chinese NPI smelters to around $13,000/t, thus removing the cost support for spot nickel prices,"" JPMorgan said. (""Metals Weekly"", Oct. 26 2020)
SURPLUS AHEAD
Such traditional nickel price drivers, particularly the strength of global stainless steel output, will dominate the market for a while yet.
Global output of stainless steel fell by 9.4% in the first half of this year and will fall over the year as a whole despite a rebound in China, the INSG said.
Next year should be a year of recovery but by how much is very uncertain outside of China, where the consensus is for this year s V-shaped recovery to level out.
Global nickel production, by contrast, has been relatively unscathed by the lockdowns that have hit other industrial metals and will grow strongly next year as Indonesia s reconfigured nickel production sector ramps up.
The INSG now sees world output of primary metal at 2.436 million tonnes this year, a marginal 40,000-tonne reduction from the Group s last forecast in October 2019. Production growth will accelerate from 2.3% this year to 6.2% next year.
The Group therefore expects the refined nickel market to register supply surpluses of 117,000 tonnes this year and another 68,000 tonnes in 2021.
These will be the first years of excess supply since 2015.
EV SLOW LANE
What then of nickel s EV story?
It seems to be losing some of its traction, according to LME broker Marex Spectron.
Interest in nickel and electric vehicles peaked early in October and ""has reversed noticeably since then"", according to what the company calls its ""Nowcast"", a series of algorithms that trawl the web to monitor around a billion text documents per year for references between specific commodities and market themes.
""This begs the question of whether the recent reversal in EV Market Focus portends a declining interest in the key demand story for the metal,"" Marex said. (""Quantamental Update - Has the focus on EV as a key nickel demand driver peaked?"", Oct. 26, 2020).
This might seem counter-intuitive given all the headlines generated by Musk s call for more nickel mines.
But COVID-19 has laid low the entire automotive sector, even if EV production is bouncing back more strongly than conventional vehicles as governments prioritise ""green"" investment in their recovery plans.
Electric vehicles currently account for less than 5% of total nickel usage and the fear, to quote Macquarie Bank analysts, is the coronavirus will translate into ""two lost years for the electric vehicle market, pushing back the requirements for new nickel supply (...) all the way out to 2025.""
This theme of deferred expectations has been playing out across the battery metals space, witness this week s news that Australian hard-rock lithium miner Altura Mining has entered receivership due to low prices for its spodumene product.
Nickel s role in the EV revolution has also taken something of a dent from Tesla itself, which is using non-nickel batteries in its Model 3 cars in China. The switch to lithium-iron-phosphate batteries reduces costs but also reflects technical enhancements to a product that was regarded as legacy technology just a year ago.
It is becoming clear that battery design is not going to be a binary competition such as the much-cited 1980s battle between Betamax and VHS in video-taping. Rather, multiple technologies will co-exist to feed a differentiated global market for vehicle functionality.
This is not to say that EVs won t be a critical component of the nickel market going forwards, just that the relationship between sales growth and nickel usage may not be as linear as previously thought.
Nickel bulls may have to defer their great EV expectations for a while yet and focus on what is happening in the currently far more significant stainless steel sector. If the INSG is right, it could be a bumpy ride."

31,2020-10-27,10:25:00,TSLA,https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-is-reporting-earnings-thursday-heres-how-to-play-it-with-options-51603808742?siteid=yhoof2,Alphabet Is Reporting Earnings Thursday. Heres How to Play It With Options.,"Text size  It is generally accepted fact among options strategists that there are 50/50 odds on betting on corporate earnings. An investor can be equally wrong or right that a stock will rise or fall when it releases earnings.  It is also a generally accepted fact that the odds can be better monetized—and even tilted to favor long-term investors—with a strategy that often favors aggressive investors with meaningful resources.  Selling options can be lucrative, especially around events like earnings that inflate puts and calls with fear or greed premiums in anticipation of the event’s conclusion. After an earnings report is released, for instance, implied volatility—which is the essence of an options price—tends to decline, meaning anyone who sold an option benefits.  Part of the allure of selling options is that the strategy is largely powered by an investor’s willingness to buy or sell a stock rather than on any short-term outlook.  Moreover, this particular earnings season also seems to favor options sellers. Investors seem distracted by the U.S. presidential election, Covid-19, and the prospect of another economic stimulus package. Stocks are often failing to move as much as priced by the options market. Examples of the muted moves include Netflix (ticker: NFLX), Verizon Communications (VZ), Tesla (TSLA), and Coca-Cola (KO), according to research from Shawn Quigg, a J.P. Morgan derivatives strategist.  Despite so many high-profile examples of stocks moving less than implied by options volatility, it is a cold, hard fact that trading around earnings is aggressive. Stocks may or may not make a strong move when the report is released. If the potential volatility is too much for you, wait until after earnings to sell options. Once the big news release is out of the way, stocks often behave with less vigor—and that also favors options-selling strategies. Some investors even prefer post-earnings trading because they think the odds are more likely to produce profits, given that stocks are less likely to make any sharp moves.  Consider Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings Thursday evening. The stock is priced in the options market as if it will move 4% up or down until the Friday expiration.  Anyone interested in trading Alphabet around earnings should focus on puts and calls that are 10% to 15% above or below the stock price, which was recently around $1,580, and on expirations of 30 to 45 days.  Selling a put expresses a willingness to buy the stock at the put strike price. The short call—a strategy that is likely best for someone who owns the stock and doesn’t mind selling at a higher price—expresses a willingness to sell the stock at the call strike price. (Call options give the holder the right to buy an asset at a set price and period, while puts give the holder the right to sell an asset at a set price and period.)  The big headwind for Alphabet’s earnings report is the federal government’s antitrust investigation into the company’s Google search engine. Investors will look for some insight from the company, which may or may not be shared after at the same time as the earnings report.  If the tenor of the earnings report, or comments on pending litigation, are really important to you, don’t consider the options-selling strategies before earnings, when the chance of a stock move is elevated. But if you can live with risk of trading an event like earnings, then selling options reflects confidence in the long-term viability of the company, either in its current firm, or in a post-antitrust form that could see the companies broken up into subsidiaries. A politicized Justice Department may challenge Alphabet, but it unlikely that anything can be done that will meaningfully harm investors.  Just look at Goldman Sachs Group (GS), which was fined $2.9 billion by the Justice Department for conspiring to bribe Malaysian officials to underwrite bonds and other business for the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. In July, Goldman also paid $2.5 billion to Malaysia to settle charges. What happened on the U.S. settlement news? The stock advanced because the bad news was defined and out of the way—and life goes onward.  The litigation threat may be bumpy for Alphabet, but the company is likely to remain an unusually valuable enterprise. After all, people will always search the internet.  Email: editors@barrons.com"

In fact, that ill-fated wager owns the crown of “worst short call” of the past five years, beating out other notable short-slayers like Apple AAPL, -4.63% and Amazon AMZN, -3.76% .  Of course, not all shorts have been caught on the wrong side of the technology leaders of this bull run. Plenty have managed to cash in on the struggles of some of the market’s biggest names in 2020.  Topping the list of winners for those who bet on falling stocks, according to S3 Partners data cited by the ValueWalk blog, is oil giant ExxonMobil XOM, -3.80% , which has delivered mark-to-market profits of $1.7 billion so far this year for short sellers. Rising crude inventories and dropping oil prices have been a gift to short-sellers, as the stock has lost more than half its value so far this year. It didn’t help that ExxonMobil lost its status as a Dow component.  Next up, AT&T T, -1.56% , the telecom company which has been bogged down with a hefty debt load, job cuts, asset sales and disappointing numbers for its pay TV platforms. Music to the shorts’ ears, as they’ve enjoyed mark-to-market profits of more than $1.5 billion.  Rounding out the list of the top five best shorts in 2020 are Wells Fargo WFC, -2.93% and Simon Property Group SPG, -1.96% , both delivering more than $1.3 billion in profits for shorts, and Raytheon RTX, -7.41% , which has resulted in a $1.2-billion win."

This means investors need to turn much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely.

The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates.

Shares are extended from a 146.30 buy point in a cup with handle.

But the stock still tumbled 10% Tuesday.  Chegg stock is forming a cup base with an 89.92 buy point, and the current weakness could lead to a new handle.  Twilio lost 1% early Tuesday after the company s earnings guidance came in below estimates.

Twilio stock ended Monday extended past a 283.44 buy point in a double bottom. Shares staged a powerful breakout on Oct. 2.  AMD-Xilinx Deal  AMD announced early Tuesday its deal to acquire Xilinx.

According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, ""JD.com s latest base comes after the China leader broke out powerfully during the week ended Aug. 21.

Hot IPO stock JFrog is trying to break out past a 90.90 buy point in an IPO base. Shares briefly topped the buy point on Monday, but reversed lower amid the stock market sell-off.

34,2020-10-27,09:01:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yes-tesla-beat-earnings-yes-130131829.html,"Yes, Tesla Beat Earnings  and Yes, Tesla Stock Is Still a Sell, Says Analyst","For a day that marked Tesla s (TSLA) fifth straight quarter of reporting positive profits, last week s 0.7% increase in the share price of Tesla stock seemed somewhat underwhelming.
Reporting earnings Wednesday night, Tesla closed trading Thursday up only modestly, and really, only barely outperforming the S&P 500 s overall 0.5% move. Tesla called Q3 its ""best quarter in history,"" with pro forma earnings coming in 36% ahead of expectations at $0.76 per share, sales of $8.8 billion about 6% better than predicted, and free cash flowing strongly -- $1.9 billion over the past 12 months.
Tesla told investors Wednesday that it remains on target to produce and deliver half a million electric cars this year, despite the fact that ""this goal has become more difficult"" to achieve in the face of Covid-19. Cybertruck deliveries are expected to begin late next year. Even Tesla s ""energy"" business -- solar roofs and solar storage -- looks ""poised for strong growth,"" said the company.
Much of Wall Street applauded the news, with R.W. Baird and JMP Securities both upgrading Tesla shares to ""outperform"" and Piper Sandler calling Tesla a ""must-own"" stock, and as both Oppenheimer and RBC Capital raised price targets on the shares. One analyst, however, stood out from the crowd for his continued pessimism on Tesla:
Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research says Tesla is still a ""sell.""
Urging investors not to forget the forest for the trees, Johnson reminds Elon Musk fans that Tesla continues to rely heavily upon taxpayer-funded subsidies in the form of tax credits for the production of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV). With automotive giants such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Volkswagen all ramping up their own sales of electric cars, though, soon they will not need to buy ZEV credits from Tesla to hit their fuel efficiency targets set by California and other ""green"" states. And this could become a problem for Tesla, says Johnson, because the sale of ZEV credits continues to make up literally all of money that has kept Tesla s profits positive these past five quarters.
Ultimately, the 100%-profit revenues generated from the sale of ZEV credits will disappear, warns Johnson, noting that ""TSLA, itself, describes credit sales as non-recurring in nature."" Although the analyst admits that Tesla s gross margins have grown nicely, hitting 25% in the third quarter even discounting the effect of ZEV credit sales, trouble emerges a bit closer to the bottom line. Johnson notes that the company remains GAAP unprofitable but for the effect of ZEV credits. Back them out, and Tesla would have lost $97 million in Q3. Indeed, back them out and... ""TSLA hasn’t been profitable ...since 3Q19.""
Of course, Tesla is famously viewed by investors as a growth stock. So isn t it possible Tesla can just grow its way out of this problem? Sell more cars, and become so profitable that it no longer needs ZEVs?
Maybe. But Johnson isn t optimistic.
From Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, Tesla has grown its ability to produce cars to a stated capacity of 840,000 vehicles per year. Despite the added capacity, however, Tesla is only predicting that it might sell 500,000 cars this year. This seems to speak to a lack of demand for the product even at present production levels, and in Johnson s view, this lack of demand explains why Tesla has cut its prices ""now 13 times in 2020 alone.""
Conclusion: Johnson disagrees with those who call Tesla ""fairly valued"" or even ""undervalued"" at its current P/E of more than 1,000 times trailing earnings. The analyst rates Tesla stock a sell, and continues to predict a 90% share price decline. (To watch Johnson s track record, click here)
Overall, Wall Street is not as bearish on TSLA as Johnson, but is not convinced on this stock, either. TSLA holds a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 9 ""buy"" ratings – but also 9 ""holds"" and 9 ""sells."" Shares sell for $420.28, and the $378.39 average price target suggests a 10% downside from current levels. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)

Going from breaking ground at the beginning of 2019 to vehicle production less than a year later, the new factory has already become a critical component to Tesla s growth story. In fact, the factory is now producing so many cars that it is beginning to export vehicles to Europe instead of just making vehicles for the local market.  Here s a closer look at the factory s production capacity -- and how it has become imperative to the automaker s continued growth.  Shipping 7,000 Model 3s from China to Europe  When Tesla first announced its factory in China, the company said the factory would be built to ship vehicles within the China market. This has been true up until now.  A Chinese news website called The Paper reported Monday morning that Tesla is shipping about 7,000 Model 3 vehicles from the Chinese factory to Europe this week, highlighting how important the factory has become to Tesla s continued growth.  Investors first learned of Tesla s plans to start shipping vehicles from its Shanghai factory to other markets in September, when Bloomberg reported that the factory may have the capacity to ship vehicles to other Asian countries and to Europe.  Impressive production volumes  According to Tesla s third-quarter update, the Shanghai factory now has the installed production capacity to build 250,000 Model 3 units annually. This is up from a capacity of 200,000 in the prior quarter.  But Tesla s Shanghai factory may soon see another huge jump in vehicle production capacity, as the automaker is currently building out its Model Y production capacity at the factory.  During Tesla s third-quarter earnings call last week, management was unsurprisingly pleased with Tesla s progress in China.  ""Then in terms of capacity build out, we re making progress on three major factories,"" said CEO Elon Musk in the company s third-quarter shareholder letter.  Musk continued:  We re continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well. The Tesla China team is just, I mean, incredibly good. ... It s like I m always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes. It s beyond all reasonable expectations.  Shanghai isn t the only place Tesla is making big progress on production capacity. During Q3, Tesla s annual production capacity at its factory in Fremont, California increased by 100,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is also constructing Model Y production lines in Berlin and Texas."

TOKYO (Reuters) - A joint battery venture of Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp aims to boost efficiency of development and production processes by 10 times to better compete with larger Chinese rivals, its chief said on Tuesday.
The venture, Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc, is now the world s largest supplier of batteries for hybrid vehicles, and was created in April by pooling part of the battery-related equipment and engineers of the two firms.
But it has a share of only 3% in the high-capacity battery market for electric vehicles, lagging far behind China s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) with a share more than 20%.
Prime Planet is moving to standardise battery designs and helping streamline operations of materials suppliers, its president, Hiroaki Koda, told a news conference.
""With efficiency ten times higher, we can win over the Chinese,"" Koda added.
Toyota, which targets electrified vehicles to bring in half its global sales by 2025, has also partnered with CATL and Chinese EV maker BYD Co Ltd for battery procurement.
Koda declined to give a time frame for the efficiency target or the scale of consequent cost reduction, but said the company would probably improve by five to six times the next version of its product, now being worked on.
Asked about Tesla Inc s promise to halve battery costs over the next several years with new technology and processes, Koda said Prime Planet had similar plans regarding technology.
""Tesla publicly announced that, so it means they will do it,"" said Koda, a former procurement executive at Toyota. ""I respect that.""
Prime Planet has taken over Panasonic s business in thin, rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries, while Panasonic retained its business with Tesla for cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops."

38,2020-10-27,03:03:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-reports-improved-miles-accidents-070328702.html,Tesla Reports Improved Miles-To-Accidents Ratio For Autopilot,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has released its “Vehicle Safety Report” for the third-quarter that contains figures related to accidents per mile involving the automaker’s vehicles with autopilot engaged and disengaged. 
What Happened: In Q3, the Elon Musk-led company registered one accident for every 4.59 million miles where drivers engaged the Autopilot, as per the report. 
In case the Autopilot wasn’t engaged, data indicates there was one accident for every 1.79 million miles driven.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration numbers indicate that there is one crash for every 479,000 miles driven in the United States, Tesla said in the report. 
Why It Matters: The latest numbers are an improvement over the same period last year, where, with the Autopilot engaged, there was one accident for every 4.34 million miles driven. Without the Autopilot engaged, there was one accident for every 1.82 million miles driven. 
Tesla also provided data for drivers that engaged active safety features, but not the Autopilot, which indicated some deterioration in safety. 
In Q3, there was one accident for every 2.42 million miles driven, while in a similar period a year earlier, there was one accident for every 2.70 million miles driven in cases only safety features were engaged and not the Autopilot.
Tesla began voluntarily releasing quarterly vehicle safety data in October 2018. 
The EV maker has made available its full-self driving software this month for beta testing and is taking a slow and cautious approach with its rollout.
Price Action: Tesla shares traded 0.9% lower at $416.50 in the after-hours session on Monday after closing mostly unchanged at $420.28.
