All Eyes On Apple, Amazon, Facebook","Dow Jones futures rose solidly late Wednesday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally came under increasing pressure Wednesday, as stocks sold off on mixed earnings reports, coronavirus cases spurring lockdowns in much of Europe and the looming election.  X  Pinterest (PINS) and ServiceNow earnings offered some hope overnight, giving a lift to several peers. But with the stock market rally reeling, all eyes are on Thursday s earnings tsunami, including Apple stock, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).  The Nasdaq composite tumbled through its 50-day line, joining the Dow Jones and S&P 500. Megacap techs, which propped up the Nasdaq on Tuesday, sold off Wednesday. Microsoft (MSFT) fell on mixed earnings. Apple stock sank to a one-month low while the FANG trio Amazon.com, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet fell back below their 50-day averages. Tesla stock and Nvidia (NVDA) closed below their 50-day lines. ServiceNow stock fell, but rebounded from its 50-day. Shopify (SHOP) tumbled toward that key level while Adobe (ADBE) is nearing the low of its base.  The most positive news from Wednesday s session may have been the surge in fear. After barely moving during the late September stock market retreat, the CBOE Volatility Index (CBOE) spiked intraday to its highest level since mid-June, though well off the March summit. The put/call ratio rose to 0.9, which is high but not extreme.  Excessive bearishness often is associated with short-term bottoms. But it doesn t have to happen right away and any bounce doesn t have to last.  Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks  Earnings After Hours  ServiceNow (NOW), Pinterest, Etsy (ETSY), Visa (V), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Livongo (LVGO) and SunPower (SPWR) reported earnings after the close.  ServiceNow rose modestly and Pinterest stock spiked. ServiceNow earnings gave a slight lift to some business software makers after several peers gave weak guidance. Pinterest earnings buoyed soon-to-report Facebook and Twitter stock, which both popped recently on blowout Snap (SNAP) results.  Visa rose modestly following weak Mastercard results. Etsy stock retreated slightly after falling just below a buy point on Wednesday. Teladoc stock and merger partner Livongo retreated as Teladoc forecast a wider fourth-quarter loss. SunPower fell modestly after rallying on sunny First Solar earnings.  Thursday Earnings  Early Thursday, Shopify stock, coronavirus vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA), Idexx Labs (IDXX) and Spotify (SPOT) are on tap.  Then the main event: Apple (AAPL), Amazon stock, Facebook and Google report Thursday night, as well as Twitter (TWTR) and many others.  Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft, Nvidia and ServiceNow stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock, Adobe, ServiceNow and Idexx Labs are IBD Long-Term Leaders. Nvidia, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft and ServiceNow are on the IBD 50.  Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures rose 0.9% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.9%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8%. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn t necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.  Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.  Coronavirus News  Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 44.73 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.17 million.  Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 9.11 million, with deaths above 233,000.  France will impose a new lockdown effective Friday, with people told to stay at home except to buy essential goods, seek medical care, exercise or go to work if their employer says the job can t be done at home. But schools will remain open. Germany will shut down bars and restaurants starting Monday. Several other European nations have imposed partial coronavirus lockdowns or other restrictions. That will take a toll on travel, consumer spending and the global economy.  So far U.S. cities and states have not sharply raised coronavirus restrictions, but Americans could stay at home more and step up social distancing measures if the pandemic continues to flare up.  Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) said Tuesday that it won t have interim coronavirus vaccine data from final-stage trials until after the Nov. 3 election, after previously signaling that it could disclose such data before the end of October.  A coronavirus vaccine won t be available until January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation s top infectious-disease official, predicted Wednesday.  Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally suffered heavy losses, closing essentially at session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.4% in Wednesday s stock market trading, undercutting its late September low to its worst level since late July. The S&P 500 index lost 3.5%, hitting its worst level since Sept. 25. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 3.7%, through its 50-day line and also to the lowest point since Sept. 25.  Microsoft became the latest software maker to give weak guidance, falling 5% Wednesday. Fellow Dow Jones stock as well as S&P 500 and Nasdaq component Apple sank 4.6%. Amazon dropped 3.8% while Facebook and Google stock dropped 5.5%. Tesla reversed 4.4%. All of these tech giants fell through their 50-day moving averages.  Shopify stock fell 5.5% after making a promising move Tuesday.  With those losses, it s not surprising the Nasdaq crumbled through its 50-day line.  Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 3.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) retreated 3.5%, with Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks notable members. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell 3.2%. Nvidia stock is a key component.  ServiceNow Earnings  ServiceNow earnings rose 22% vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 30% to $1.15 billion. Analysts had seen ServiceNow earnings of $1.03 a share on revenue of $1.11 billion.  The business software maker also guided slightly higher on subscription revenue for Q4.  The ServiceNow earnings report and guidance follow warnings or weak guidance from several software makers. German software giant SAP (SAP) issued a major warning on Sunday. Microsoft, Twilio (TWLO) and Dynatrace (DT) gave mixed guidance this week That all followed the warning by Fastly (FSLY), which missed lowered views late Wednesday.  ServiceNow stock rose 2.3% overnight. NOW stock sank 3.15% on Wednesday but found support, for now, at its 50-day line.  Adobe and Salesforce.com (CRM) edged higher after sinking more than 4% on Wednesday.  Pinterest Earnings  Pinterest earnings shot up to 13 cents a share vs. 1 cent a year earlier. Revenue leapt 58% to $443 million. Analysts expected Pinterest earnings of four cents a share on revenue of $383.5 million.  PINS stock shot up 32% in overnight trade. Shares fell 6.2% to 49.25 on Wednesday but were already greatly extended.  Facebook stock climbed 2.7% and Twitter nearly 6% after both lost more than 5% Wednesday ahead of their earnings Thursday night.  Stock Market Analysis  On Monday, IBD changed the market direction classification to ""uptrend under pressure."" Suffice it to say that the stock market rally is under even more pressure now.  With coronavirus concerns soaring and such crucial events as Thursday s earnings tsunami and next Tuesday s Election Day, it s hard to make the case to step up exposure. Apple and Amazon earnings could be great and investors cheer the election results, but that s just a guess. Right now, the stock market rally is reeling.  Dow Jones futures are up, but just a fraction of what the major indexes lost on Wednesday.  Trying to get ahead of the market rally in the past few weeks has meant jumping in just as the tide recedes.  Recent breakouts and early buy points have largely failed. Many leaders have broken down. Investors should be cutting their holdings and awaiting renewed stock market vigor before making new buys. That could come in a few days, weeks or months.

1,2020-10-28,20:49:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/servicenow-projects-robust-sales-workflow-213034382.html,ServiceNow Projects Robust Sales on Workflow Software Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- ServiceNow Inc. projected subscription sales in the current quarter that narrowly topped Wall Street estimates, signaling that companies are continuing to invest in upgrading their business workflow software while employees remain stuck at home.
Subscription revenue will be $1.15 billion to $1.16 billion in the period ending in December, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $1.13 billion. The company raised its fiscal-year subscription sales forecast to as much as $4.26 billion from about $4.23 billion.
Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott has pledged to turn 17-year-old ServiceNow into a “software juggernaut.” The company has a plan to reach $10 billion in revenue, on an unspecified time frame, from selling applications that help companies organize their personnel, customer service and IT operations and transition to more online work.
Like rival Salesforce.com Inc., ServiceNow has offered clients a set of software tools to help them safely return to their offices during the coronavirus pandemic. The National Basketball Association and Women’s National Basketball Association used the company’s applications to resume their seasons during the pandemic, McDermott said on a call with analysts. The U.S. Senate, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs also signed deals with ServiceNow in the third quarter, he said.
“The reality is, others came into the market with good marketing; we came into the market with a great product that was ready to implement in minutes,” McDermott said in an interview. “That’s why we have thousands and thousands of downloads, hundreds of customers and we’re operating at mass scale.” Uber Technologies Inc. selected ServiceNow because it needed a system up and running in two weeks and no other software maker could do that, he added.
Salesforce has said its product, called work.com, is being used by 60 government customers worldwide, including 35 U.S. state agencies and federal agencies including NASA.
In the third quarter, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue increased 31% to $1.09 billion, compared with analysts’ estimate of $1.06 billion. Total sales increased 30% to $1.15 billion in the period ended Sept. 30. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.21 a share. Analysts projected $1.03.
McDermott said companies are using ServiceNow’s software to address a variety of needs, even in the face of business slowdowns during the pandemic, which has forced them to change “on the fly.”
“You’re hiring people, you’re on-boarding people, you need to train people, you need to provide people a self-service employee experience on mobile,” the executive said. “And by the way, you actually need to keep them safe if you do give them the option of coming into the office.”
Shares rose more than 2% in extended trading after closing at $484.05 in New York. The stock has climbed 71% this year.
ServiceNow also appointed Apple Inc. executive Larry Jackson to its board of directors, now enlarged to 11 seats. Jackson, the global creative director of Apple Music, will be ServiceNow’s first Black director. McDermott said in a statement that Jackson would bring a focus on customer experience to the board.
The software maker earlier Wednesday said it named Gabrielle Toledano, previously of Keystone Strategy LLC and Comcast Ventures, as chief talent officer effective in January.

2,2020-10-28,20:17:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-warns-weaker-outlook-even-001723933.html,Samsung Warns of Weaker Outlook Even as Profit Beats,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. warned earnings in the current quarter will decline, saying the strong growth in its mobile and memory business that helped third-quarter profit beat will ease amid intensifying competition and weakening demand.
The world’s largest maker memory chips and personal electronics said net income rose a better-than-expected 52% to 9.27 trillion won ($8.2 billion) in the three months ended September, beating the 7.54 trillion won average of estimates. Samsung foresees capital spending of about 35.2 trillion won this year because of a migration to more advanced chip processes and a buildout of its contract chipmaking business.
The South Korean giant is seeking to regain the lead as the world’s largest smartphone maker after losing the crown earlier this year to Huawei. It introduced new mobile devices during the quarter, benefiting from the gradual reopening of economies worldwide and delays to handset launches by rivals including Apple Inc. The U.S. restrictions on Huawei also prompted rush orders from the Chinese telecoms titan ahead of the Sept. 15 deadline, benefiting Samsung’s memory division.
Looking ahead, Samsung Electronics expects profit to decline in the fourth quarter amid weakening memory chip demand from server customers and intensifying competition in mobile phones and consumer electronics.
“The mobile communications business is likely to see smartphone sales decline and marketing costs increase due to competitive market environment. In consumer electronics, profitability is expected to weaken on growing competition and rising costs, despite solid demand,” Samsung said in the earnings release. “For 2021, the company expects a recovery in overall global demand but uncertainties will remain over the possibility of recurring epidemic waves of COVID-19.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Samsung Electronics may continue to deliver stronger-than-expected earnings, in our view, on a rebound in smartphone shipments. Huawei’s declining appeal among overseas consumers and a delay in this year’s new Apple iPhone release could aid Samsung’s market share gain, as reflected in its 3Q preliminary profit beat. However, Samsung’s memory chip profit looks set to drop from 3Q’s surprise increase.

Samsung shares have surged nearly 40% from their March lows. The stock slipped 1.2% on Thursday after the earnings report.
Click here for a live blog on the numbers.
Sales of smartphones jumped nearly 50% during the September quarter as the rollout of its latest Galaxy Note series and a new foldable device reignited demand of premium handsets that had flagged during the coronavirus pandemic. Handset shipments may have climbed to as many as 79 million units during the period, Samsung Securities estimated before the earnings announcement.
Overall demand for memory exceeded expectations in the third quarter, boosted by Huawei and other mobile customers. While mobile demand may continue to remain strong in the fourth quarter and into the first half, server orders are likely to be weak with the prolonged pandemic prompting clients to slow orders, Samsung said.
Server memory prices are already correcting. Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell 9% in the September quarter, according to InSpectrum Tech Inc. Prices for 128-gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips decreased about 8% in the third quarter. Rival Micron Technology Inc. cut capital spending plans last month, warning about weaker demand from some corporate customers and forecast possible oversupply of flash memory chips next year.
The death of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee over the weekend may add to further uncertainty. While his son Jay Y. Lee is expected to take over as chairman of the group, the younger Lee still faces two trials over allegations he used bribery and accounting trickery to smooth his path to succession. The family will also have to pay billions of dollars in inheritance tax, and Samsung has so far declined to comment on how they will fund the payments.

3,2020-10-28,20:08:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-reports-strong-revenue-ad-200752762.html,Pinterest Reports Strong Revenue as Ad Demand Rebounds,"(Bloomberg) -- Pinterest Inc. reported quarterly sales that topped analysts’ estimates after advertiser demand bounced back from budget cuts seen during the initial outbreak of Covid-19. The shares surged.
Third-quarter revenue jumped 58% to $443 million, the digital search and scrapbooking company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $387.8 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also predicted that sales would increase about 60% in the holiday quarter, which would be higher than analysts’ projections of 38% growth.
Pinterest said it had 442 million monthly users at the end of the period, a gain of 37% from a year earlier and higher than the average estimate of about 431 million. The shares jumped more than 30% in extended trading.

The San Francisco-based company said in July that revenue growth increased about 50% in the month, though it expected the numbers to decline throughout the quarter. But advertiser demand stayed high during the three-month period ending in September as advertisers adapted to the new reality brought on by the coronavirus. Pinterest specifically cited an uptick in small business advertisers, retailers and large advertisers of consumer packaged goods.
Chief Executive Officer Ben Silbermann attributed some of Pinterest’s user growth to the changing environment as more people move communication and activities online. “More than ever before, people are coming to Pinterest to get inspiration for their lives,” Silbermann said in the statement.
Pinterest also said it received a boost of almost 4 million monthly active users when young people upgraded their iPhones to Apple Inc.’s new operating system, iOS 14, and used Pinterest to come up with ideas for new background filters.
Pinterest’s third-quarter revenue growth is another sign the digital ad industry has returned to pre-Covid levels -- an idea that was reinforced last week when Snap Inc. also reported better-than-expected sales. Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Twitter Inc. report earnings on Thursday.

This is your Daily Crunch for October 28, 2020.
The big story: Apple seems pretty interested in search
Apple has a growing interest in search technology and might even be working on a product to compete with Google, according to The Financial Times.
The most visible change is the fact that in iOS 14, Apple is now showing its own results when you type queries in the home screen. In addition, there seems to be an increase in activity from Apple s web crawler.
There may be more of an opportunity here as the U.S. Justice Department has sued Google over what it claims are anticompetitive behaviors around search. However, this doesn t necessarily mean Apple and Google will soon be going head-to-head in search — it could just be a sign that Apple s Siri voice assistant is getting more search queries.
The tech giants
Joe Rogan, Alex Jones and Spotify’s illusion of neutrality — Spotify is facing criticism after Joe Rogan brought Alex Jones of InfoWars onto his show.
Audible further expands into podcasts — Audible is adding approximately 100,000 podcasts.
Apple eyes the TikTok generation with an updated version of Clips — The update brings much-needed support for vertical videos, allowing for sharing to TikTok and the “Stories” feature in other social apps.
Startups, funding and venture capital
DoubleVerify, a specialist in brand safety, ad fraud and ad quality, raises $350M — DoubleVerify s technology can detect fraud, viewability and brand safety.
Outrider raises $65M to bring its autonomous tech to distribution yards — The startup has built a three-part system that includes an autonomous electric yard truck, software to manage the operations and site infrastructure.
Lunchbox raises $20M to help restaurants build their own ordering experiences — CEO Nabeel Alamgir said that if restaurants can handle more online orders themselves (rather than just relying on delivery apps), they’ll make more money while also maintaining a direct relationship with their most loyal customers.

Video Transcript  SEANA SMITH: Let s get to another big story that we ve been watching here at Yahoo Finance today. And that, of course, is the-- going off, I guess, some of that broader pressure that we saw in the market today. Some of those Big Tech stocks were amongst the worst performers in the market today. And this, of course, comes as the CEOs of Facebook, the CEO of Twitter, and the CEO of Google testifying before Congress earlier today.  Those three executives really facing questions about how they moderate content on their platforms. Dan Howley is here with more on this for us. And Dan, I guess my question to you is, did we hear anything today, or did we make any progress, maybe that s a better way to say it, on addressing some of those concerns that a lot of these congressmen have on hate speech, on censorship, or on Section 230 protections?  DAN HOWLEY: No. Basically today was exactly what you probably had expected to be a sideshow for conservative lawmakers to basically say, there s some widespread conspiracy among these three tech giants to silence conservative voices, despite a complete lack of evidence showing anything as such. There were some discussions about Section 230 in general, how it relates to misinformation, disinformation, hate speech, things along those lines.  They did-- the companies say that they were open to forms of regulation that would help them decide how and when to take content down or to remove content. But there wasn t really anything too substantive. The Democratic lawmakers said that they objected to the hearing in its totality because it was being held before an election, several days before an election.  And it was a topic that would have helped Republicans in their election efforts. And so it really came down to essentially accusations flying back and forth. And the three CEOs attempting to answer, Jack Dorsey was the one that seemed to get the worst of it, surprisingly, it s usually Mark Zuckerberg that gets it, but Jack Dorsey, in his very long beard, had gotten a lot of heat there because of the decision by Twitter to block a ""New York Post"" article recently that alleged to connect Hunter Biden, Joe Biden s son, with Joe Biden and business dealings in Ukraine.  Story continues  But that article has also been largely scrutinized by other media outlets because of the providence of those emails being called into question. So it really seemed to be kind of an out free-for-all at points, and at other points, just a way for different members of Congress, senators, to kind of get their five minutes of fame, basically.  RICK NEWMAN: Hey, Dan, this hearing aside, there has been some more scary sounding rhetoric on Section 230 from the perspective of the tech companies. I mean, you ve got the Trump Justice Department now saying that it favors changing those-- that law to basically tighten up on what the tech platforms are allowed to publish. Do you see any chance of anything possibly changing with regard to Section 238? Or is this just a lot of smoke and no fire?  DAN HOWLEY: I think there will eventually be some form of change to 230. What it means for the internet, though, you know, that s a big question, right? The existence of 230 allowed for the modern internet to exist, in essence, at all. It s the foundational bedrock of the modern internet, allowing people to post online to these platforms.  And for those platforms to then regulate, to a degree, in good faith, those posting. So for instance, they re able to take down hate speech or harassment without facing any kind of liability issues. And, you know, if there is a change, it could wholesale change how the internet exists. We may not have, without 230, the kinds of sites that exist now, including Google and Facebook and Twitter, regardless of whether or not you believe that there is some kind of bias on one side or the other.  Democrats, if President-- if Joe Biden is elected, would want to see a move against 230. Joe Biden has said, in particular, he wants to see that change. President Trump has taken steps to make changes, ordering the FCC and FTC to look at it. So there are moves now to see some kind of change.  This, though, just seemed to be some kind of circus event ahead of the election for lawmakers to just kind of, like I said, get their time in the sun and kind of get their little pet peeves out in front of these high-name executives. And don t forget, we re going to see the Judiciary Committee talk to some of these folks as well.  So it s not as though this was like a one-time event, two of these same people were just before the House about a month ago, or maybe a month ago, I can t even remember. They re there so often now that it seems to be just an issue that we re going to keep going back to for some time. But, you know, if there is some kind of change to Section 230, it will be kind of a seismic shift in the internet itself.  SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Dan, certainly, this has not been a one-time event. It s not the first time any of these executives have been on Capitol Hill. And I think it s safe to say it probably isn t the last time that they will be making an appearance."
6,2020-10-28,17:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/d-davidsons-tom-forte-big-210006602.html,D.A. Davidson's Tom Forte on big tech regulation,"Tom Forte, D.A. Davidson Sr. Research Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee on section 230 and his thoughts on regulating big tech.  Video Transcript  MYLES UDLAND: An extremely busy couple of days for major tech companies began today. We had the executives from Twitter, Facebook, and Google on Capitol Hill testifying before lawmakers. Of course, we also have these companies and a few others reporting their earnings tomorrow night after the bell. Joining us now to discuss all of this is Tom Forte, he s a senior research analyst over at DA Davidson.  So Tom, let s start with what we heard from these executives on Capitol Hill today, kind of a follow up to the main event back in July. Did the tone of these conversations, in your view, change at all? Does it change how your thinking about regulatory risk for each of Twitter, Facebook, and Google?  TOM FORTE: The way that I think about it is the commonality between the Republicans and the Democrats, as seen in the House Judiciary Committee 400-page plus report, is that they realized that they need to scale back the excess influence these companies have, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. And then for today s testimony, throw in Twitter. The harder challenge is how to do it.  So we have an antitrust case against Google that s live today. And then today, they were thinking about removing the protections when it comes to who s liable for posting on social networks. So I think the commonality we know is that Democrats and Republicans agree that they need to rein in the excess influence. But I think it remains to be seen, and it s a work in progress on how they will ultimately do that via antitrust or regulation.  MYLES UDLAND: And then just speaking, I mean, today, again, was about the Section, kind of, 230 rule there. And as you think about the protections that that provides to these companies, is there a way-- like, would there have to be an entirely new law written, I guess, in your view, to make the content on these platforms the problem of the companies? Or is there a new way to apply this Section 230?  Story continues  I know this is kind of a legalese, but certainly, that is part of the calculation here, I guess, in thinking about whether these companies truly face a major regulatory risk that would upset their business model.  TOM FORTE: So from a business model standpoint, the way I think about it is user-generated content is not free. So to the extent that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are going to have to police that content. Think, for example, if there was a one-minute delay between when you tweeted when Twitter determined if your tweet was appropriate and then when your tweet hit Twitter.  So I think that this is ultimately going to increase the cost of user-generated content. Having low-cost user-generated content versus, call it, professional content was what enabled the social networks to success-- have success against old print media. But I think this is ultimately going to raise the costs of doing business for these companies.  MYLES UDLAND: And then, I guess, as it raises the cost of doing business for the incumbent companies, does it make their positions, I guess, in a roundabout way, and I think this is what folks are concerned about as well, does it solidify and entrench these networks as primacy in our lives if it s more expensive to operate a network? It would be more expensive to start up a new network, and so on.  TOM FORTE: So my argument is no in this regard. So if the solution at the end of the day is essentially having a disclaimer at the end of a post, why couldn t a startup also have a disclaimer at the end of the post? So I think that you have two things that are going on. On one hand, they re trying to figure out a way to address who s responsible for the content of the network.  On the other hand, they re trying to rein in the excess influence that big technology companies have. So in my opinion, it s hard to envision a solution that makes it more difficult for a startup.  MYLES UDLAND: And Tom, I want to kind of transition now to the earnings that these companies are set to report tomorrow. And just thinking about their broad place within the market environment right now. As you think about these businesses and as you think about their stocks, their import to the rally, the kind of questions you re getting from investors on them, well, what are you expecting to see in these reports, and how are you thinking about these companies , kind of, continued growth? And we ve seen a lot of growth pulled forward, Microsoft, very interesting quarter last night. How are you thinking about that part of the story for these companies as we head into 2021?  TOM FORTE: Yep, so for Facebook and Google and Twitter in particular, they re advertising-based business models. So the big surprise last time when the CEOs testified on Capitol Hill was they followed that testimony with a blowout quarter. I mean, just huge numbers in the June quarter for Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.  So to the extent that there s data points suggesting that spending in the election was twice the rate of 2016, and to the extent that Facebook, Twitter, and Google are all generating advertising revenue from politics, an argument can be made that they will post very strong numbers, which makes the whole situation a little more ironic, I guess.  MYLES UDLAND: And then, I guess, in thinking about, you know, that pillar of the ad spend that you re seeing on those networks, there was a lot of concern very early in the pandemic that, you know, a second order effect would be businesses closing. Then they re not spending as much money on these networks. Therefore, ad spending goes down, and it hurts these businesses.  We haven t really seen that play out sort of at all so far in the pandemic. Is that something that you re wary of, or did that thesis maybe kind of fall off early on here?  TOM FORTE: It s a great point, and you definitely saw, to varying degrees, a material pullback in ad revenue in March and in early April. So with a second COVID spike now going on to the extent that that results in perhaps a new round of shelter in place, with business closures and economic weakness, then advertising revenue could once again be under duress. So the question will be, how do we manage the second spike?  Are we sheltering in place, or are we trying to manage it with masks, social distancing, things of that nature? And I think it s important to follow that to determine how that may affect the economy and ultimately advertising."

On Wednesday, they looked prescient.
U.S. stocks tumbled the most since June with rising virus cases threatening the economic recovery. More than $2 trillion has been wiped from the value of American equities this week and Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked to the highest in four months.
Big tech companies from Apple Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. led the rout, their shares having gotten so expensive relative to expected earnings that further price gains became hard to justify. Software giant SAP SE set off alarms on future profit when it warned revenue would suffer well into 2021. A day later, U.S. tech darlings exacerbated market volatility for the second time in two months after a summer of gains that outpaced the broader market’s advance by 10 times.
“There’s uncertainty around the coronavirus surrounding the impact of another wave of shutdowns,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., said by phone. “If one of these other tech companies talks about lockdowns affecting their earnings in 2021 the way SAP did, we’ll have a big problem.”
The S&P 500 fell 3.5% to close at the lowest in five weeks. Tech shares in the gauge sank 4.3%. Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. lost more than 5%. The VIX jumped almost seven points to close above 40.
The worry over future earnings is spiking just as big tech lines up to report results. Investors punished Microsoft Corp. even though its third-quarter profit beat expectations and its forecast was mostly in line with estimates. The stock plunged more than 4%.
Up next are the other four of the market’s five biggest constituents that have a combined $5 trillion in market cap. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet all report Thursday after the close. All are expected to show a strong third calendar quarter, but the focus will be on how they see the end of 2020 and the start of next year.
“Because tech has supported the market’s rally in 2020, the earnings of those big tech companies are going to really drive sentiment,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “The risk is that it could drive it in a negative way and add on like a snowball rolling downhill to this selloff.”
Buyers had piled into the tech giants for the safety provided by their strong balance sheets and products that cater to stay-at-home demand. They stayed with them as the economy rebounded because of their size advantage. But with the virus rampaging and Congress unlikely to shore up the economy with an aid package, speculation has mounted that tech earnings won’t be able to meet lofty expectations.
That’d be fodder for bears like David Einhorn, who called an “enormous” bubble in tech stocks and said his firm has added bearish wagers. The big top for tech stocks may have occurred on Sept. 2, according to the president of Greenlight Capital, who cited a surge in trading of call options and a growing industry concentration among signs of excessive euphoria. Since then, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has plunged almost 10%.
“Bubbles tend to topple under their own weight. Everybody is in,” Einhorn wrote in an Oct. 27 letter to investors. Greenlight has adjusted the portfolio of companies it’s wagering against by adding a fresh so-called bubble basket of mostly “second-tier companies and recent IPOs trading at remarkable valuations,” he added, without identifying specific stocks.
Usually earnings tend to calm the market during periods of stress. But not this time. Among S&P 500 companies that have disclosed results, 85% beat analyst estimates and are on pace for the best showing since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1993. That’s doing little to excite buyers who have watched the index rallying as much as 60% from its March trough and valuations reaching levels not seen since the dot-com bubble.
On the contrary, traders are taking profits off the table. As a result, shares of companies in the S&P 500 reporting quarterly earnings have dropped 0.8%, on average, the next day. Tech shares have fared the worst, falling 2.7%, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
“The stock reaction tomorrow from AMZN, FB, GOOG and AAPL will be telling as to whether tech can keep up this dramatic pace of outperformance,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, referring to the tickers of the tech giants. “A regime change is at hand as valuations begin to contract.”
Tech firms have yet to prove that the boost in businesses during the pandemic is not fleeting. Microsoft gave a second-quarter forecast for revenue in some divisions that fell short of the highest analysts’ projections. Earlier this month, Intel Corp. reported a surprise drop in sales of chips for data centers, potentially signaling a drop-off in demand for expansion of the server farms that underpin cloud-computing services. Netflix Inc. missed Wall Street’s estimates for subscribers, renewing doubts about its ability to maintain growth as pandemic lockdowns go away and competition intensifies.
“There is no question that these companies have great business models, have executed well and stand to benefit from how the economy is reshaping itself, but there are questions about if they have gone too fast, too far,” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “Parabolic valuation increases can only be justified by extremely strong guidance. A lot of great companies have seen incredible gains in their stock prices.”

But, a year after launching, that’s starting to change.  In a sign the company’s TV platform is turning a corner, comedian Jon Stewart will come out of semi-retirement for a current affairs series on Apple TV+, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Stewart has made only a few public appearances since leaving his 17-year role as host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show in 2015. The comedian likely could have gone to any network or streaming service. That he chose Apple speaks to the company’s recent strides in the entertainment industry.  Earlier this year Apple signed former HBO CEO Richard Plepler and his production company to a partnership to make TV series, films, and documentaries exclusively for Apple TV+. Stewart’s forthcoming show is the first publicly announced project that is a result of the deal with Plepler, who will serve as an executive producer. Plepler is one of the most respected names in television, and previously worked with Stewart at HBO on a series of projects that never came to fruition.  The Stewart news comes as Ted Lasso is quickly turning into a hit for Apple TV+. The comedy, starring Saturday Night Live alum Jason Sudeikis as an American college football coach asked to manage an English soccer club, boasts an 86% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and has enjoyed strong word-of-mouth buzz since debuting in August. Just days after it launched, Apple renewed it for a second season.  Meanwhile, Apple announced last week it obtained the exclusive streaming rights to the Peanuts holiday specials, including A Charlie Brown Christmas. Bloomberg reported Apple is now interested in buying rights to more existing shows and movies in order to build a library of content that’s more competitive with the likes of Netflix and AT&T’s HBO Max. When Apple TV+ launched, it had no back catalog, instead relying entirely on its original programming.  But now the company is both buying streaming rights and also improving its own content. Earlier this month it released a film from director Sofia Coppola, On the Rocks, which has earned plaudits from critics and could net Bill Murray, one of the film’s co-stars, an Oscar nomination. Its May film Greyhound, starring Tom Hanks, had a viewership that was “commensurate” with that of a theatrical box-office hit, Deadline reported. And now Apple will release Martin Scorsese’s next movie, an adaptation of the book Killers of the Flower Moon, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. The service also won its first Emmy, for The Morning Show actor Billy Crudup, last month.  All of these projects suggest the service is moving out of a proof-of-concept phase and into something more culturally significant. Apple needs Apple TV+ to become a service consumers actually want to opt into, rather than one they don’t even realize they have access to, as is the case with millions of iPhone users. As of May, Apple TV+ had about 10 million subscribers, but a chunk of those were users on a free trial (Apple has not divulged its current subscriber numbers). The service costs $5 per month.  The only thing ever truly holding back Apple TV+ from taking off was the content. Apple has the brand, money, and distribution to quickly make a streaming service successful, even in a crowded market. But a service is only as good as the content available on it. For the first year of Apple TV+, that content was spotty, at best. Now, thanks to the company’s ongoing investments and smart hires, Apple TV+ is making noise."
10,2020-10-28,14:51:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/only-thing-come-tech-hearing-185105921.html,The only thing to come out of tech hearing is bipartisan support for tweaking 230: Analyst,"Santosh Rao Head of Research at Manhattan Venture Partners joins Yahoo Finance’s Zack Guzman to break down the Wednesday s Big Tech hearing.  Video Transcript  ZACK GUZMAN: Of course, we just wrapped up a few moments ago that big tech hearing with CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai in front of the Senate Committee on commerce. It was supposed to focus on the liability questions tied to these big tech companies. Didn t necessarily hear all about Section 230 or questions around that, but a lot of posturing from politicians around potential censorship on that front, too.  And as we re watching all this play out, I should note Twitter shares are the biggest losers today among those big tech companies, off about 5%. And for more on what that means for these firms, I want to bring on our next guest, Santosh Rao. He s head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, and he joins us now.  And Santosh, I mean, we were talking about this political pressure just a few weeks ago when we last heard from these big tech CEOs. A lot of that was focusing on anti-trust issues. Now we re talking about censorship in Section 230. You said that these firms have been playing by the rules as long as they re there. What s your take on the sell-off we re seeing today on some of these names and the pressure now mounting?  SANTOSH RAO: Yeah, I think the sell-off is also because of the broad market sell-off. You know, you have the European thing, the shutdown, and all that. It s not necessarily because of this 230 issue here. I think the hearings by themselves, it was very political theater, like you mentioned.  I think the only thing that came out was that there is bipartisan support for tweaking 230, if not adjusting it. I don t know how they ll adjust it, but something needs to be done around transparency and accountability. How it s going to be done is going to be a long process.  I think both the companies, the companies have said that they re willing to work with regulators to give more accountability and give some certainty so people know what are the guardrails around them. But how we get there is going to be a whole different debate. You saw the both sides come on. You have the conservative view, the liberal view.  Story continues  I don t know where it will settle, but one thing we know, we need Twitter, we need these social media platforms. That thing is established. Free expression is important. Public safety is also important. So that balance will be debated for a long time now.  ZACK GUZMAN: Yeah, and there s a bit of a catch 22 when you think about Section 230 here and how President Trump has been calling to take that away and what it might do. Obviously, it s legal protections for these platforms to not be held accountable for things that are posted there. They obviously have been called on, on the left here to try and police misinformation that s been on their platforms.  But if you take 230 away, it might actually stoke taking more down. And it could backfire in terms of what Republicans want. So it seems like a whole can of worms that none of these tech companies really want to get into to maintain the status quo and not have to worry about this issue as much as they might otherwise need to if things change.  SANTOSH RAO: Sure, sure, I totally agree with that. I mean, you need 230. And like anything else, you just need to tweak it around and get it to a point where it s acceptable. The nation is divided. Opinions are divided. So you re going to see this debate for a long time.  It s not the social media s fault. Yes, there are some abuses or apparent abuses or looked like there were abuses on the margins. But overall, they serve a big need for-- they re a public square essentially. And we need that. We need that dialogue.  But, you know, like I said, you really can t regulate that. You can t regulate public opinion, public square free expression. So it s going to be a very delicate balance. We ll see how it plays out. But one thing is established. Companies are willing to work with the regulators, and the regulators need to be aware that this is important.  ZACK GUZMAN: One last question to you on this, too, because we re going to get Twitter s latest update to investors on their quarter on Thursday. And we are seeing, to your point, I mean, the S&P is off 3%, but communication services, which includes all those names, off by about 3 and 1/2%. Tech off 3 and 1/2%, the biggest losers today.  So when I point to that and ask you about why these names might be beaten down around this or not, what s your take on what we might get when Twitter reports its third quarter? Because RBC, among other firms, saying that they might expect strong results there with the return of live sports. Obviously, the election coming up. A lot of ad money coming in around that, too. So what s your expectations for where we see these tech firms, Twitter specifically, trade?  SANTOSH RAO: Yeah, I expect very good numbers, very good report from them. And this is the sweet spot for them. And at the elections, at any big event, those play right into Twitter s hands. So I think in terms of execution, they re doing a good job. And everything s working well. So I expect a good quarter.  So what s going to pull down the whole thing is the whole tech sentiment. I mean, there is a feeling that the whole valuations is stretched, and they need to pull back a little bit. That can pull down. But in terms of individual performance. I think they will report very good numbers, and we expect that."
11,2020-10-28,14:48:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-search-crawler-activity-could-184828345.html,"Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop-shop","Encouraged by the spate of antitrust activity brewing in both the Justice Department and on Capitol Hill, Apple  may be developing a search competitor to Google, according to a report in the Financial Times.
That would be a move rife with irony as the push for an end to anti-competitive practices is seemingly creating greater competition among the largest companies which already dominate the technology industry rather than between those established companies and more nimble upstarts.
Signs of Apple s resurgent interest in search technologies can be found in both a subtle but significant change to the latest version of the iOS 14 iPhone operating system and increasing activity from Apple s spidering tools that are used to scour the web and refine search functionality, the Financial Times reported.
Apple is now showing its own search results and linking directly to websites when users type queries from its home screen in iOS 14. For context, this is a behavior that has been known for a while as people have seen the feature pop up in beta versions of iOS. And the search volume being up on Apple s crawler is something that Jon Henshaw of Coywolf had noted back in August.
Sources cited by the Financial Times said that the change marked a significant step-change in Apple s in-house search development and could be the basis for a broader push into search.
The Cupertino, California-based company certainly has the expertise. A little less than three years ago it nabbed Google s  head of search, John Giannandrea,  in what was widely seen as an attempt to shore up Apple s foundations in artificial intelligence and voice search via Siri. Because of the way that Apple is organized internally, it s unlikely that Giannandrea will be devoting full-time effort to both a potential ""search product"" and Siri . But it s within the realm of possibility that he could be lending his expertise to a team working on a separate feature.
Any development of a search tool would be a third way for Apple to capture search, which now uses Google as its default search service thanks to a lucrative contract between the two (one that s also at the heart of a Justice Department inquiry into Google s purported anti-competitive activities around search). The only other major search services on the market rely on Microsoft s Bing to power their results.
The Justice Department has filed its antitrust lawsuit against Google
While the signs do point to an actual uptick in activity, there could be an explanation for Apple s crawler activity that s less heavy on corporate skunkworks skulduggery and more in line with goals that Apple s stated pretty clearly.
While the story about Apple getting into direct competition with Google on search makes for a great headline, the uptick in activity could be explained equally as rationally by Siri getting more search queries and being more of an interlocutor between Apple and search services like Google or Microsoft s Bing. This disintermediation is something that Google began years ago and has even modified and expanded over the years to combat the same kind of behavior from Siri.
Some of this comes down to semantics. By ""search engine"" do we mean ""a web site that people type queries into"" or do we mean a voice assistant that steps in to white-label web results with its own sourcing. Cutting down on the brand presence of a monster like Google on your own platform is a powerful motivator for any competitor, no matter the space.
Making Siri a one-stop shop could inoculate Apple in the scenario where they are forced to enable a search provider choice in the iOS onboarding flow by regulation. It won t do anything to help Google though, which pays Apple billions because iOS users are worth way more than any other mobile web users to its business. Google, for its part, says that when people have a choice they still pick Google anyway. Perhaps another reason why making Siri the search equivalent of an overtalker is the strong play for Apple."
12,2020-10-28,13:36:00,AAPL,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/28/why-alphabet-stock-sank-today/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,Why Alphabet Stock Sank Today,"What happened  Class A and C shares of Alphabet   have sunk today, down by 5% and 4% as of 12:10 p.m. EDT, respectively, following a report that Apple  is ramping up its development of a competing search engine. CEO Sundar Pichai is also testifying today in front of Congress to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.  So what  Google has long paid Apple billions of dollars per year to be the default search engine in iOS, a lucrative deal for both tech juggernauts that has come under scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The Department of Justice formally filed an antitrust complaint against Google just a few days ago, arguing that the arrangement undermines competition. Details around the deal are closely guarded: Apple previously refused to tell Congress how much it gets from Google, but analysts estimate that it could be as much as $12 billion.  In part due to intensifying scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators, Apple is now ""stepping up efforts to develop its own search technology,"" according to The Financial Times. The Mac maker confirmed many years ago that it had created a web crawler bot called Applebot to index web pages for Siri and Spotlight.  The report notes that Apple poached Google s former head of search and artificial intelligence (AI), John Giannandrea, in 2018. He now serves as head of machine learning and AI at Apple. Experts have also noticed increased activity from Applebot, according to Financial Times.  Now what  Investors are worried that one of Google s most important business arrangements -- the DOJ estimates that almost half of all Google search traffic comes from Apple gadgets -- could be at risk.  The Senate Commerce Committee is also trying to evaluate if Section 230 ""has outlived its usefulness."" Section 230 shields tech platforms from liability associated with content posted by users.  ""The United States adopted Section 230 early in the internet s history, and it has been foundational to U.S. leadership in the tech sector,"" Pichai said in his opening remarks. ""It protects the freedom to create and share content while supporting the ability of platforms and services of all sizes to responsibly address harmful content."""
13,2020-10-28,13:34:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/frances-online-ad-lobbies-file-173421804.html,France's online ad lobbies file antitrust complaint against Apple,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Four French online advertising lobbies have filed an antitrust complaint against Apple over changes the iPhone maker will make to privacy features within the next version of its mobile operating system, they said in a statement on Wednesday.
Under the new Apple operating software, iOS 14, iPhone owners will be asked whether they re ready to allow installed mobile apps to gather a key identifier used to define campaign ads and send targeted ads.
The four associations - IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM - said the changes brought by Apple did not meet European Union privacy rules. They added Apple failed to hold itself to the same standards, as it would still be able to send targeted ads to iOS users without asking them for prior consent.
""This case is not about privacy; it is about Apple abusing its market power to distort competition,"" the four associations said in a joint statement.
The opt-in permission is to be registered via a pop-up box from early 2021.
""With iOS 14, we re giving users the choice whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for the purpose of advertising, or sharing their information with data brokers,"" Apple said in a statement.
""We believe privacy is a fundamental human right and support the European Union s leadership in protecting privacy with strong laws such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation),"" it said.
The new iOS 14 privacy features could lead to severe revenue decline for publishers and drive many ad tech vendors out of business, the four associations said."
14,2020-10-28,13:31:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-reports-earnings-amid-iphone-173159587.html,"Apple Reports Earnings Amid iPhone 12 Rollout, Investors Continue Eyeing Big Tech's Leadership","As one of the largest and most widely held companies in the world, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) often exerts outsize influence on the market. That’s been especially true in 2020 as Tech companies took on the mantle of market leadership, helping send the broader market both higher and lower, depending on the day.
Lately, however, Tech has been in a bit of a funk, losing some leadership to the more “cyclical” sectors like Financials and Industrials as many investors hope for an economic revival. Also, some of what we’ll call the “pandemic names” like Workday Inc (NASDAQ: WDAY), Docusign Inc (NASDAQ: DOCU), and the Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ: TTD) have pulled attention away from the “mega-caps.” Still, AAPL’s recent rollout of the iPhone 12 and its stock split put the company back in the spotlight.
Apple never lacks attention when it reports, even when its earnings compete with three other “FAANG” stocks for attention. That’s the case when AAPL opens its fiscal Q4 books Thursday after the close, but with CEO Tim Cook’s company still brandishing a $2 trillion market cap, anything AAPL says or does will probably stand out on the crowded calendar.
Questions On iPhone 12 Rollout, Sales Of Macs, iPads
One big question heading into earnings is how the new iPhone 12 is doing after its launch just a few weeks ago. A move to 5G may end up being a tailwind for the iPhone 12 as carriers give special offers to help woo customers to their higher-speed offerings.
However, there’s likely to be plenty of competition both here and abroad as other companies take advantage of 5G, so how does AAPL see the race shaping up? And how many current iPhone users will head to the Apple Store of their choice (or online) to replace their phone with a 5G model? Early signs look good, analysts say, but AAPL could shed more light Thursday.
Alongside more clues about iPhone sales, investors should look at demand for iPads and Macs. These products, which a few years ago had dropped off the radar a bit, have gotten new life in 2020 given the increased working, playing and learning from home sparked by the pandemic. Sometimes those clues can come ahead of time by checking how companies that make “peripherals” for AAPL products are doing.
For instance, Barron’s pointed out, consider a recent earnings report from Logitech International (NASDAQ: LOGI), which said that iPad accessories were up 144% in the quarter. This has some analysts feeling optimistic going into AAPL’s reporting date.
Service Update
AAPL used to be mostly a products company, but these days services mean a lot, too. The services business encompasses everything from the App Store to licensing deals, and Services revenue came in just a touch below analysts’ expectations in FY Q3. Maybe analysts were just too optimistic, because services did grow almost 15% year over year, not a shabby showing considering the pandemic.
Last time around, dollar value sales of the company’s marquee products gained ground. Sales of iPhones rose more than 1.6% year-on-year while Mac sales jumped more than 21% and iPad sales rose more than 31%. That helped Apple report blowout 11% revenue growth when a Refinitiv analyst consensus had expected a roughly 2% decline.
However, AAPL didn’t share guidance last quarter. Will it decide to do that this time? If it does, that might play well on Wall Street, where there’s hunger for more corporate insight into 2021 and beyond.
A Hot Stock That Cooled Off
Apple’s strong FY Q3 earnings performance helped shares, which have more than recovered what they lost during the coronavirus-sparked selloff earlier in the year. Shares also got a boost after the company announced a four-for-one stock split toward the end of July. The company’s stock hit a record high early last month after the split went into effect, but shares have pulled back since then.
Retail investors often use stock splits as trading opportunities, accessing popular names that may have gotten too expensive on a per-share basis. But sometimes buying interest cools off a little post-split.
Also, there’s AAPL, the consumer electronics behemoth, and there’s AAPL, the component of the Tech sector. And in that regard, AAPL has been part of a larger story of a Tech surge, followed by sector rotation and profit-taking.
Last month saw a wider pullback in tech-related stocks that helped pull down AAPL shares along with the rest of the industry (see figure 1). After leading the market higher as tech-related names became a popular trade, the wind got knocked out of those sails as investors seemed to decide to take some money off the table.

The Baby And The Bathwater?
Tech became a crowded trade earlier this year as investors flocked to big names hoping to get in on the sharp rally. That rally may have been sparked by people looking to mega-cap names because they wanted to be in equities but also wanted the perceived safety of large established players that were benefitting during the pandemic.
There’s also the “cash is king” concept—and that’s one place where AAPL tends to outshine most of its peers. According to company filings, AAPL had nearly $200 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of Q2. That can put it in a position of power to weather potential storms—such as a deep recession—and perhaps make a strategic acquisition or two.
The recent pullback leaves Apple’s shares well below their record as we head into the earnings report later this week. While that could seem like a bargain opportunity for some, the stock is still up strongly on the year and its valuation is well above the historic norm, which might raise eyebrows.
Amid Tech Leadership, Antitrust Concerns
The leadership of tech-related companies to either move the wider market higher or lower may not necessarily fade as coronavirus worries continue.
But there are other factors also affecting the tech world, such as antitrust stirrings. Still, Apple may not be as susceptible to that as other companies because the iPhone maker has stiff competition from other device- and computer-manufacturers.
While that competition may be a boon from an antitrust standpoint, the likes of competition from Samsung, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is still a force that Apple has to reckon with, and something investors have to put into their calculations.
Apple Earnings And Options Activity
AAPL is expected to report adjusted earnings of $0.71, down from $0.76 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $64.1 billion, roughly flat versus a year ago.  
The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 3.4% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker MoveTM indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.
Looking at the October 30 expiration, put activity has been heavy, with concentrations at the 110 and 112 strikes. Even higher numbers have been seen to the upside, with the 120 calls dwarfing others, but with heavy concentrations also at the 115 and 125 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 43rd percentile as of Wednesday morning.

Ringing The Bell On Q3 Earnings: How Well Has FB Handled An Ad Boycott?"
15,2020-10-28,13:14:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-eyes-tiktok-generation-updated-171438603.html,Apple eyes the TikTok generation with an updated version of Clips,"Apple  is today rolling out an update to its video creation app, Clips, which brings much-needed support for vertical videos, allowing for sharing to TikTok and the ""Stories"" feature in other social apps. The addition is one of several arriving with the release of Clips 3.0, which also introduces support for horizontal video, as well as HDR for iPhone 12 users, along with other smaller changes, like new stickers, sounds and posters, for example.
Apple s Clips was first launched in 2017 with an eye on being a first stop for video creation before publishing to Instagram. But the app s support for only square-formatted video has since become outdated. Casual social videos today are often now published to newer video-centric social media networks, like TikTok  and its short-form rivals, including Triller, Dubsmash, Instagram Reels and others.
Meanwhile, Stories -- like those found on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest and, soon, Twitter -- have become a key way that today s users publish content to social media.
Apple, in fact, says that support for vertical video had become its No. 1 request from users since Clips launched.
Apple’s Clips app is social video editing that’s simple to a fault
Clips 3.0 supports both 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios, in addition to the square format. When the app is opened on iPad, it will default to the landscape format, which can be particularly useful in educational scenarios where teachers are using the app in classrooms with students.
On iPad, Clips users can also interact with the app when their iPad is in a case, like Magic Keyboard for iPad and others. It also supports use with a mouse or trackpad, and allows users to write text in text fields using Apple Pencil.

The new app will also now support recording HDR video footage with the rear-facing camera on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro.
Clips  overall user interface has been refreshed, too. You ll notice a redesigned record screen that floats on top of the viewer when shooting vertically or horizontally, which could help to address some user complaints of the app feeling ""slow.""
Users will also be able to more easily view and access the various Effects options, their Clips Projects and other media.
The tweaks to the user interface also feel a bit like a nod to TikTok. For example, you can now swipe up on the Effects to see a full-height card that shows you the available stickers and text labels to add to your videos. This format of a pop-up card filled with effects is similar to TikTok -- though there it s opened with a button tap and not a gesture.

The update also brings more content options, including eight new social stickers (like ""Sound On"" for Instagram Stories), 24 new royalty-free soundtracks (bringing the total library to 100), and six new arrows and shapes. From the new Media browser in Clips, you can pull in your own photos and videos or toggle over to a Posters section to pick from 70 customizable, animated full-screen title cards that can be added to your video.
There are also updated filters, Live Titles and Selfie scenes available.
When your project is complete, you can easily share the resulting video to social networks from an updated sharing screen that includes quick access to destinations like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat, in addition to standard options like iMessage or saving the file locally.
Apple’s iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max: what’s the difference?
Though Clips hasn t had as much attention as some of Apple s other apps -- its last update was six months ago, for instance -- it has gained a following. Apple says that users create ""millions"" of Clips projects per day, and it sees higher usage in the U.S., U.K. and China.
This year, Clips usage increased by 30%, Apple noted -- a change that could have been brought about by the shift to virtual schooling which saw teachers in need of tools for creating digital content.
Image Credits: Apple
With its expanded focus on vertical video, Clips has the potential to reach a much broader audience.
Today, many users prep videos for Stories or TikTok on third-party apps, like InShot, Prequel, Splice, PicCollage, Canva, VSCO, Funimate, KineMaster, Magisto, CapCut and others topping the App Store charts. But Clips, until now, couldn t compete because it didn t include vertical video support at all."

With Alphabet s  Google division fending off a Justice Department antitrust probe over its search dominance, the new capability could give Apple an opportunity to compete across more services.  The Financial Times reports Apple made a little-noticed change to the iPhone s operating system by showing users searching from the home screen its own search results with links to sites.  Google pays Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion a year for the exclusivity of being the iPhone s default search engine, but the partnership might be questioned by Justice Department investigators.  Antitrust lawyer Sharis Pozen told the Times that Apple needs to ""walk a fine line"" in its responses for receiving such large sums that helped cement Google s dominance. The Justice Department could demand others receive equal access to iPhone search.  In that regard, it sounds similar to the antitrust cases that were brought against Microsoft  almost 20 years ago for bundling its Windows browser with its operating system.  Although Apple has the financial wherewithal to attempt to make inroads into Google s search dominance, others have tried and largely failed to make a dent. Microsoft s Bing has been around more than a decade, for example, but still has less than a 7% share of the market.  Yet not everyone is convinced Apple is actually building a full-throated competitive product. The Times quoted Columbia Business School associate professor of business Dan Wang as saying that because Google has developed massive scale over the years, it would be ""extremely difficult"" for Apple to effectively compete.  Still, developing its own search tool gives the tech giant a fallback position in the event the Justice Department untethers its relationship with Google."

A number of IBD 50 stocks also flashed sell signals. General Electric (GE) was a notable winner, however, rising on surprise earnings.  X  Coronavirus Cases Spike  According to the Worldometer data tracker, the cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 9 million on Wednesday. Total virus-related deaths rose past 232,000.  The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 44.3 million Wednesday, with more than 1.17 million virus-related deaths.  Hospitalizations are rising again in the U.S., though they remain well below the heights reached in July. Daily deaths also remain stable below the 1,000 mark. Nevertheless, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health Adm. Brett Giroir said on the Today show the nation is at ""another critical point in the pandemic response.""  U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 26757.33 -705.86 -2.57 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3304.15 -86.53 -2.55 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11108.42 -322.93 -2.82 Russell 2000 (IWM) 154.47 -3.71 -2.35 IBD 50 (FFTY) 36.74 -0.90 -2.39 Last Update: 12:00 PM ET 10/28/2020  S&P 500, Nasdaq Fall  The S&P 500 fell by 2.4% amid the broad pullback. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down an even worse 3.1% before shaving that decline to around 2.7%. This move saw it knife through its 50-day moving average. Losing this key technical support level is a bearish sign.  Volume was concerning as the bears battered the bulls. It was well up on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. It was up around 60% on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday, according to early data. Trading was up by around 54% on the Nasdaq. CAN SLIM investors prefer for volume to be lower on a down day.  All sectors were down, with energy, technology and communication services the worst performers.  The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) was also battered lower, slipping by 2.6%. There were just a handful of winners on the IBD 50, led by Meridian Bioscience (VIVO), which gained 4.3% and D.R. Horton (DHI), which was up 1%.  Visa, Apple Stock Down As Dow Jones Bleeds Red  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was slammed lower as bears went on the rampage. At around 12:10 p.m. ET, the index trimmed some losses but still fell by 2.4%, with all but one component slipping lower.  The worst performers included American Express (AXP), which dipped 3.2% and Apple (AAPL), which surrendered 3.4%. The move saw Apple stock lose further ground on its 50-day line.  Insurance giant Travelers (TRV) was the sole winner, managing to gain 2.5% and reversing sharply off its intraday low of 116.33.  IBD 50 Stocks Flash Sell Signal  For a market leader, the 50-day moving average — which computes a running average of price closes over the past 50 trading sessions — acts as a resistance level during a downtrend.  If a stock breaks below the 50-day line in heavy volume and can t rally back, it s often a signal that buying demand is drying up and the stock s run is ending. One or two bursts of institutional selling often act as a prelude to more profit taking ahead. It can take a fund several weeks to exit a position due to the amount of stocks it holds.  A number of IBD 50 stock lost their 50-day lines amid the bearish sell-off, though there is time yet for them to regain this medium-term moving average. They include names such as Amazon (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Intuit (INTU). This is in addition to the likes of Digital Turbine (APPS), Fortinet (FTNT), Lam Research (LRCX) and Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP).  Investors should keep a close eye on these stocks to see how they perform in the coming sessions.  GE Stock Surges  Shares of General Electric jumped nearly 9% to 7.73 on the stock market today. GE stock is working on an 8.67 buy point off a cup base that s part of a bigger, far-deeper consolidation. However, the industrial giant has been meeting resistance at the 200-day line.  GE stock got a big boost after the firm handily beat Wall Street earnings expectations. The firm avoided an expected outright loss in the third quarter. Instead earnings fell 60% to 6 cents a share as sales sank 17% to $19.4 billion. Aviation revenue tumbled 39%, with health care revenue off 7%. Power segment revenue grew 3%, with renewable energy up 2%.  Nevertheless, GE burned through $4.3 billion in cash in the first half of 2020, due to its weak commercial aviation business. On the second quarter earnings call on July 29, Culp warned that the ""macro environment could deteriorate further"" and forecast a lengthy aviation recovery.  This Stock Breaks Out  Pet products e-commerce retailer Chewy (CHWY) broke out from a cup with handle with a 70.82 buy point. Chewy s relative strength line also hit a new high, which is a bullish indicator.  It spiked on the news the firm is launching a telehealth service for pets. The ""Connect-with-a-Vet,"" which launched Wednesday, allows customers to get advice in real time from a licensed vet about their dogs or cats. It is free for customers who are part of Autoship subscription program, which sends deliveries of food and other goods.

Sure, the occasional unexpected headline might distract and buffet a stock every now and then, but for the most part, the market has a knack for evaluating a company and pricing shares at appropriate, risk-adjusted levels. The hard part sometimes is understanding what the financial metrics are really saying.  An investor can listen to some of the data being explained and easily get what it s trying to say, but there are some ideas that are just easier to understand in pictures than they are in words. The financial metrics regarding consumer technology giant Apple  are no exception to this reality.  Here are five financial ""pictures"" that will visually help any investor gain a better understanding of where this tech company is, and where it seems to be going.  1. For better or worse, Apple is a Western company  Apple s CEO Tim Cook has always been bullish on China as a big growth driver for the company, even since 2017 when the iPhone s sales tanked in that particular market. Much to the delight of shareholders, China s consumers became interested in its wares again by the end of that year.  The fact of the matter is that the other side of the planet remains a much more important market for Apple right now. The Americas alone account for nearly half of Apple s business, while Europe makes up about a fourth of the company s top line.  Of course, Europe and the Americas are a relatively bigger deal now than they were then, largely because China and the rest of Asia still aren t exactly growing for Apple.  2. Services growth is offsetting the iPhone headwind  Apple may have stopped reporting the number of iPhones it sells as of early 2019, but a close look at its quarterly results since then reminds us the company never stopped reporting total iPhone revenue. That may be the more important figure of the two, especially given Apple s deliberate development of its services arm that reflects app and media revenue.  To this end, notice how services revenue has pretty much offset any headwinds related to saturation of the smartphone market, and now accounts for roughly one-fifth of the company s total business. That s ultimately a function of how many iPhones are still in active use, and not necessarily tethered to new phone sales.  3. Big operating margins for services  Sales of physical products like Macintosh computers and the iPhone may contribute more to the bottom line, but not as much as those product revenues might suggest. The operating margins on digital goods and services (revenue minus the costs associated with offering apps, videos, music, etc.) is more than twice the profit margin percentages of hardware. Although they only make up around one-fifth of Apple s sales, services drive about one-third of the company s operating earnings.  4. Heavy cash flows easily fund the dividend, and more  Ergo, the steady revenue and income production of digital services, in conjunction with its consistently marketable iPhone, makes Apple a cash-generating machine even in more challenging environments. Notice that cash flow easily covers the amount of earnings the company s been dishing out in the form of dividends.  5. More revenue and earnings growth in store  And where s it all going? Analysts are modeling more of the same growth into the future, anticipating a strong rebound next year out of this year s lull. Respectable single-digit sales growth is in the cards for 2022, which mirrors the pace established before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.  Per-share earnings are expected to grow at an even faster clip, thanks to continued stock buybacks that mathematically make each share more profitable, by reducing the total number of them. Of course, this has long been the case for Apple."

The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 44.3 million Wednesday, with more than 1.17 million virus-related deaths.  Coronavirus Stock Market Rally  According to IBD s The Big Picture, the coronavirus stock market rally is starting to falter amid recent institutional selling.  Tuesday s Big Picture commented that ""The Nasdaq Composite s 0.6% gain ate into Monday s sell-off. That s bullish. Yet it recouped well less than half of that day s 1.6% pounding. Volume lightened vs. the prior day. This suggested institutional investors bought cautiously. And the Nasdaq itself, while holding above the 50-day moving average, is not far from testing that key technical level again.""  An uptrend under pressure means investors need to be much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash.  Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good. The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates.

Stock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest  Microsoft Earnings  Dow Jones leader Microsoft smashed Wall Street s targets for the September quarter. The company earned $1.82 a share on sales of $37.2 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts expected Microsoft earnings of $1.54 a share on sales of $35.72 billion.  With respect to guidance, Microsoft expects $39.5 billion to $40.4 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue. The middle of that range, at $39.95 billion, is below some analyst estimates for revenue of $40.43 billion.  Shares fell over 3% Wednesday after ending Tuesday just above its 50-day line amid a 1.5% gain. Shares are approaching a 225.31 buy point in a cup with handle.  Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 35.2% through Tuesday s close.  Dow Jones Earnings: Boeing  Boeing topped third-quarter forecasts Wednesday and said it expects further employee reductions amid the coronavirus pandemic and its 737 Max grounding. The company plans to lay off an additional 11,000 by the end of 2021, bringing its total number of employees to 130,000 vs. over 160,000 at the start of this year.  Boeing stock fell over 2% in early trade.  Stock Market Earnings: Enphase, First Solar  Enphase Energy advanced 3% early Wednesday. The company reported earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of $178.5 million. Analysts expected Enphase earnings to fall to 24 cents a share on revenue of $169.7 million.  First Solar soared as much as 17% in morning trade. The solar company s earnings surged 400% to $1.45 per share, with revenue up 70% to $928 million. That blew out analyst views for First Solar earnings of 60 cents a share and sales of $707.7 million.  Stocks Near Buy Zones: JD.com, Shopify, Tencent  JD.com is approaching a cup with handle s 85.49 buy point. The stock is about 3% away from the new entry after Tuesday s 2% advance.

22,2020-10-28,10:03:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-apple-140310382.html,Earnings Preview for Apple,"On Thursday, October 29, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) will report its last quarter s earnings. Here is Benzinga s preview of the company s release.
What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share?
Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company s profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Earnings And Revenue
Wall Street analysts see Apple reporting earnings of $0.71 per share on sales of $64.16 billion. Apple reported a profit of $3.03 per share when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $64.04 billion.
What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter?
Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company s performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values.

If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, EPS would have fallen 76.57%. Revenue would be up 0.19% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company s EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past:

AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 71 cents per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.05% heading into earnings season.
Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Apple, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Further, strength in user base is expected to reflect on advertising-revenue growth despite the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on ad spending and ad-targeting-related headwinds. Notably, changes made by Apple AAPL and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google in their mobile operating systems and browser platforms limited Facebook’s ability to track the user-activity trend.Moreover, ad sales for the to-be-reported quarter are expected to take a hit from advertiser exodus despite an improving ad-spending environment. Notably, a number of companies, including Starbucks, Coca Cola and Verizon, among others, have announced plans to freeze ad spending on Facebook due to its failure to eradicate hate speech and misinformation.The consensus mark for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s third-quarter advertising revenues is pegged at $19.43 billion, indicating 11.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

Facebook added BlueJeans, GoToMeeting, Webex and Zoom Video ZM to Portal in the third quarter, making the device more remote-work friendly for users confined at home due to the coronavirus-led disruptions.Markedly, the introduction of Workplace on Portal has driven frictionless communication among users working remotely. Facebook also introduced Workplace Login and has been focusing on improving security and privacy of the device.In fact, Facebook’s initiatives toward data protection and privacy issues are expected to attract old and new users and help it compete with rivals like Apple’s iMessage.Notably, Apple’s iMessage, the leading messaging app in the United States, is already an end-to-end encrypted service. Moreover, multiple messaging apps such as Telegram (with more than 200 million monthly active users), Signal and Wire, among others, have been able to increase the size of their user base by promising full end-to-end encryption and greater user privacy on their platforms.
Markedly, Facebook’s efforts to integrate Whatsapp, Instagram and Messenger are likely to help it create a privacy-focused communications platform. The company is focused on initiatives like private group chats and person-to-person communications instead of the newsfeed style of public broadcast Facebook is known for.During the to-be-reported quarter, Facebook reportedly began integrating Instagram and Messenger chats. The social-media giant also confirmed integrating Messenger Rooms shortcut on both Instagram and WhatsApp. Users can now access Messenger Rooms, which allow group video calls of up to 50 people with no time limit, via WhatsApp on the desktop.Notably, a common Facebook account linkage across service apps will provide Facebook with consolidated user information from all platforms. Undoubtedly, the company’s user base of more than 3.14 billion (including its Family of services — Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) presents a large canvas for advertisers and makes the platform still highly attractive.

25,2020-10-28,09:36:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-remain-skittish-anxiety-stays-133616891.html,Investors remain skittish as anxiety stays high: RPT,"Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous and Brian Sozzi discuss how investors are feeling one week ahead of the 2020 Presidential Election with Investopedia Editor-In-Chief, Caleb Silver.  Video Transcript  ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: And of course, with the 2020 presidential election less than a week away and the coronavirus news still very present in our lives, investors are remaining wary. Joining us now for more is Investopedia s Editor-in-Chief, Caleb Silver.  Caleb, good to see you. You re out with your anxiety index. And I m wondering how much investors are worried about the virus versus worried about the election. What did you find out?  CALEB SILVER: Hi, Alexis and Brian. Good to be with you. Well, we ve been serving our readers since the pandemic began back in March-- actually, before it was a global pandemic, because those anxieties were rising. The last two times we surveyed them-- and we just closed the most recent one-- the election has been their primary concern. And it remains that way today, even more than a resurgence in COVID.  They re concerned about the presidential election. They re concerned about the aftermath of the presidential election and potential social unrest. But they re also concerned about what the dynamics of a different-- of a Biden presidency or a Trump presidency, a re-election, would mean to their portfolios.  So they are all over our content about the Biden tax plan, the Trump tax plan, the infrastructure spending plan, capital gains taxes. They re very worried about what this might mean to their portfolio. But they re also worried about this rising level of volatility that we see in the markets and we re seeing this morning. It feels like we re in a Mel Brooks movie right now.  BRIAN SOZZI: Caleb, how concerned they-- how concerned are investors about economic shutdowns? I would make the argument, the reason why we re seeing this volatility and the sell-off like we re seeing today, investors forgot that shutdowns because of COVID-19 remain in play-- not just in the US, but also overseas.  Story continues  CALEB SILVER: Right. Only 36% cited that as their top concern. But again, we closed the survey last week. The last two or three days, and especially what s happened over the weekend in Europe and parts of the rural United States, that s very concerning. So the fact that more and more people are talking about shutdowns-- we re hearing what s happening in Germany. We re hearing what s potentially happening in France.  You know that stuff comes this way pretty fast. We saw it in the spring. And I think investors have that and that fear sort of in the back of their mind. That happened almost like that in March and April, and then we obviously went into a bear market and a recession.  We ve come out of it, so the strength has been there. But they re really concerned about what s going to happen here in the next week. They don t have an opinion about who is going to be elected president. They re just concerned about what the volatility in the stock market s going to mean overall to the performance, especially since we ve had that recovery since April.  ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: You know, I dug into the survey a little bit, and I saw 62% of people believe that the stock market is overvalued right now. 71% believe that we re seeing this disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street. But how many people are bracing for another big painful short-term drop?  CALEB SILVER: More than half of our respondents feel like we re going to get a big drop in the next three months. We ask them that question every time we survey them, which is about every five to six weeks. But the last two surveys, they said we re going to get a correction or more in the next three months. And now they re saying it again.  They were right the first time we had that little correction a few weeks ago. And now they re fearing another one coming. And obviously, you can see what s happening in the markets today. I m not saying they predicted it to a T, but there is so much volatility.  And you see those outflows coming right now, especially out of the big ETFs. Bloomberg had the story about the SPY losing a lot of money through outflows. We re seeing a lot of big money sit on the sidelines and pull back, especially in popular areas. And you can just sense this fear of coming back in right now, and people wanting to wait this out.  BRIAN SOZZI: I guess this is somewhat unsurprising, Caleb. Investors remain heavily allocated to big-cap tech stocks-- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.  But look, we re going to have some big social media companies. Their CEOs are going to be up on the Senate today getting grilled over section 230. Do you think now is the moment investors should take a step back and really reassess the futures for some of these big-cap tech plays?  CALEB SILVER: I think they would love to do that. But these tech plays have been the only game in town really since April, driving the market higher. Yes, there have been the stay-at-home stocks-- the Zooms, the Pelotons, the Docusigns, and what have you. But the big mega-cap tech stocks, as you guys know, bring markets higher. And they bring them down when they go lower.  So nobody really wants to see a breakup right now, especially if you re long these stocks. And every big ETF, every big index fund, and every big hedge fund owns these stocks. They re also the most popular among individual investors. So yes, our readers are heavily loaded into them, like everybody else.  And this hearing that we re going to see today, it could be a little bit of a show. But that said, when you look at what the Department of Justice has recently done with Google and the antitrust suit and all the other suits that are mounting with the FTC and the DOJ around big tech, something is going to happen in the next few years. Whether that knocks some valuation off of their trillion dollar market caps or not, we don t know, because they could almost be more valuable broken up.  But there is this concern that their business as usual will not be business as usual going forward. They ve been protected by this Section 230 since 1996, before they even knew their advertising potential as mediums.  ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: So Caleb, what are your clients doing when it comes to these big tech stocks, especially with all the headwinds that they may be facing? Are they holding on to them? What are they doing with their portfolios with the overhang of the election?  CALEB SILVER: We don t have clients yet, because we re a financial education website. But our readers, who are very invested-- they are very smart. they read our newsletters every day. They ask us really smart questions. These are people that have been in the market, in some cases, for 30 or 40 years or people who have been at it in just the last few years.  They re holding on to the winners and playing and staying with the-- the dance partners they ve recovered with over the last six or seven months. The older cohort is pulling back, holding onto more cash, and bracing with more savings for the future. They don t want to be overexposed.  The stocks that they re keeping-- and these are older investors, 55 or older, typically in the South and typically in the Northeast, as far as our audience. They re going to cash, and they re holding the blue chip dividend-paying stocks that they ve owned for years and years.  ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: All right. Investopedia s Editor-in-Chief Caleb Silver, always good to see you.  CALEB SILVER: Thanks for having me."

Since most iPhone purchases are upgrades nowadays, the installed base grows at a much slower pace. The company gave its first official disclosure in early 2019, when the global iPhone installed base hit 900 million.  ""We plan to provide information on the iPhone install base as well as total install base on a periodic basis,"" CFO Luca Maestri said in January of that year. Other than vague comments about the installed base hitting all-time highs, Apple hasn t given investors a formal update on it since. One analyst thinks that key metric has now hit the 1 billion milestone.  1 billion and counting  Independent analyst Neil Cybart at Above Avalon published a research note this week estimating that Apple topped 1 billion iPhone users last month. The Cupertino tech giant stopped disclosing unit volumes a couple years ago, in part because investors and analysts were too focused on that metric, which doesn t fully capture the health of the core iPhone segment.  Instead, Apple has successfully shifted the narrative -- and investor attention -- to emphasize its booming services segment, which is built in large part on monetizing the installed base with paid subscriptions, digital content sales, and more. That s why the Mac maker has been introducing so many new first-party services and now discloses how many paid subscriptions are being billed across its platforms.  A Billion iPhone Usershttps://t.co/Y9mtJsuUst    According to my estimate, Apple passed the billion iPhone users milestone last month. Odds are now increasing that Apple has not experienced peak iPhone sales. — Above Avalon (@AboveAvalon) October 26, 2020  ""In recent years, the pace of growth in the iPhone installed base has slowed,"" Cybart wrote. ""Much of this slower growth is due to high smartphone penetration and Apple having already successfully targeted the premium end of the smartphone market.""  Despite that deceleration, the analyst estimates that Apple is still adding around 20 million to 30 million new iPhone users every year. The iPhone tends to act as a gateway product, introducing new users to Apple s expansive ecosystem of hardware and other services.  What comes next  Apple will continue to focus on three areas for the iPhone, in Cybart s view. The company will keep pushing the envelope with the iPhone camera, strengthening the overall value proposition by extending the average iPhone s life span, and adding more to the feature set so that the iPhone can do just about anything that users need it to.  ""Odds are increasing that Apple has not experienced peak iPhone,"" according to the analyst."

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report is challenging Google (GOOGL) - Get Report in its most profitable business segment, internet search, according to a report.  Apple has quietly increased its efforts to develop its own search technology for iPhones, according to a report by the Financial Times.  iPhone users with the latest Apple operating system, iOS14, now get internet search results from Apple s engine as a default instead of Google s.  The move by Apple, Cupertino, Calif., comes as U.S. regulators are currently scrutinizing the $8 billion to $12 billion Google pays annually to make its search engine the default on numerous devices.  Apple s web crawler, Applebot, which automatically visits million of web pages to improve search engine results, has increased its activity in recent weeks, according to the FT.  Apple has a big job ahead of it if it wants to compete with Google, which is reportedly used 1.2 trillion times per year worldwide.  Just last week, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Google, alleging antitrust violations, following a 16-month investigation into the practices of big tech. The agency alleges that Google, Mountain View, Calif., is abusing its market position to stifle competition.  Part of that investigation includes the multibillion-dollar deal Apple has with Google to ensure its search engine remains the default on the iPhone.  Big tech is on deck with Apple, Google, Facebook (FB) - Get Report and Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report all scheduled to report their quarterly results after the closing bell on Thursday.  Apple shares at last check were down 1.5% to $114.91 while Google fell 1.8% to $1,569.40.  Apple and Google are holdings in Jim Cramer s Action Alerts PLUS investing club.

This is likely to have boosted personal computer (PC) sales in the third quarter.In fact, PC sales witnessed the strongest growth in a decade during the third quarter buoyed by strong demand from consumers working and studying remotely. Overall, PC shipment grew 3.6% to 71.4 million with 90% growth coming from Chromebooks, according to Gartner. Lenovo, the largest PC maker by shipments in the quarter, was the largest beneficiary of the trend with shipments growing 8.3% year over year to 18.3 million. HP HPQ, Dell DELL, Apple AAPL, and Acer rounded out the top five PC manufacturers.Although desktop demand was weak, gaming PCs and notebooks with cellular modems remained strong. In particular, graphics cards based on Nvidia’s NVDA new GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 gaming GPUs enjoyed high demand while Sony SNE and Microsoft MSFT saw strong pre-orders for their next-generation consoles (read: Video Gaming Thrives in Pandemic: 3 Top ETFs to Gain).Given the resurgence in COVID-19 infections and no immediate signs of a vaccine, the PC market is expected to remain strong for the rest of the year. As such, investors could ride out the surging PC market with these technology ETFs — iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF IGM and Invesco DWA Technology Momentum ETF PTF. These have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting their continued outperformance.Even though all three funds target the broad sector, IYW focuses on software and services. IGM provides investors exposure to hardware, software, Internet marketing, interactive media and related companies. Meanwhile, PTF targets companies with relative strength (momentum), software being the top industry (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Apple and Microsoft are the top holdings in both iShares ETFs. Meanwhile, Five9 Inc FIVN is the top firm in Invesco ETF, followed by Apple. Further, IYW is ultra-popular and comes with a low expense ratio of 0.43% compared to 0.46% for IGM and 0.60% for PTF.

31,2020-10-28,06:30:00,AAPL,https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-earnings-preview-antitrust-lawsuit-51603835149?siteid=yhoof2,Alphabet Reports Earnings Tomorrow. Heres What to Know.,"Text size  Days after the Justice Department launched a landmark antitrust civil action against Alphabet, the company is set to report its third-quarter earnings Thursday after the close.  Alphabet’s (ticker: GOOGL) typical quarterly results aren’t exactly the stuff fireworks are made of, but this time CEO Sundar Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat potentially have more to discuss with investors than the norm. The lawsuit could represent a serious threat to Google if improperly handled, and Justice Department officials signaled that it was merely the first action resulting from its 16-month investigation, and more could be in the pipeline—the department has other large tech companies in its sights too.  Google has called the lawsuit deeply flawed and has said it plans to vigorously defend itself in court. The company issued a lengthy rebuttal to the Justice Department’s complaint in a blog post on Oct. 20.  Citi Research analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note to clients last week that the Justice Department suit casts a wide net and claims all of Alphabet’s search agreements are illegal. To him, that suggests the investigators didn’t find a smoking gun, and could potentially mean a positive outcome for the search giant.  “This case is not the beginning of the end for Alphabet’s legal woes,” Bazinet wrote. “It is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”  Newsletter Sign-up Review & Preview Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what s likely to matter tomorrow. PREVIEW  The antitrust suit, however, contained several notable details beyond the main thrust of the government’s argument. Investors learned—if the figure is to be believed—that Google is paying somewhere between $8 billion and $12 billion in fees to Apple (AAPL), for the Cupertino, California, company to prioritize Google’s search engine in its various pieces of software, such as iOS and the virtual assistant called Siri.  According to multiple reports, the payments to Apple totaled about $1 billion in 2014, and have evidently risen steadily since. In accounting parlance, the Apple payments are considered traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, which analysts watch closely. For the third quarter, Alphabet is expected to pay out $7.61 billion in TAC overall, and Wall Street models full-year payments of $30.77 billion.  Alphabet’s traffic costs are scrutinized because they directly affect the bottom line. The sell side models Alphabet will turn an adjusted profit of $14.45 a share, and GAAP earnings of $11.39 a share. Without TAC, analysts expect third-quarter revenue of $35.32 billion. In its quarterly and annual financial statements, Alphabet discusses TAC but doesn’t detail to whom or what such payments are made or details about any deal with Apple.  Truist analyst Youssef Squali wrote a positive note on Sunday about Alphabet, reiterating his Buy rating on the stock. He says the ad-market recovery signs are convincing enough that he expects solid third-quarter results. The additional disclosures Alphabet has made around YouTube revenue and cloud computing will also let investors more closely examine how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected different segments of the business.  Of the analysts that cover Alphabet, 39 analysts rate the stock a Buy, and four have a Hold. There are no Sell ratings. The average target price is $1,770.48, which implies an upside of 12% from Monday’s closing price.  Alphabet is set to report results after the closing bell Thursday, and will have a conference call with investors at 4:30 p.m. ET. A raft of other tech titans report Thursday, including rival Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Apple, among others.  Executives from Alphabet, Facebook, and Twitter are set to testify before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on Wednesday. The hearing is about section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and whether it has outlived its usefulness, among other things. The section carves out a broad exemption from litigation stemming from the content users post to online platforms. The hearing is set to kick off at 10 a.m. ET.  Write to Max A.

The system then uses the technology to create smart tags, thereby making the video searchable.  The deal occurred earlier this year and was worth roughly $50 million, according to the report, which cited ""people who asked not to be named.""  Apple provided a boilerplate statement about the acquisition, saying, ""Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,"" the company said.  Vilynx s website, which has since been shut down, outlined the system s ability to not only recognize content, but also to understand it in context. The technology created rich previews of the video s content, while also making it searchable. It could also provide AI-based recommendations, and could recognize topics that were trending on social media and other websites.  ""Recognition is detecting Michael Jordan s face,"" the website noted. ""Understanding is knowing it s Michael Jordan, the former NBA basketball player who played for the Chicago Bulls and went to the University of North Carolina.""  The company s office in Barcelona will become one of Apple s main AI outposts for research and development and is hiring to increase its staffing there. About 50 Vilynx employees will stay on, including Elisenda Bou-Balust, its co-founder and chief technology officer.  Apple could use the technology to help improve Siri s search capability while also augmenting its existing photo-tagging and search features.  The iPhone maker has been on a buying spree in 2020, acquiring Inductiv, which uses AI to find and correct errors in data, voice recognition start-up Voysis, and Xnor.ai, which made on-device AI more efficient while using less power."
33,2020-10-28,05:10:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-snaps-ai-video-startup-091013293.html,Apple Snaps Up AI Video Startup For $50M To Enhance Apps  Report,"Apple has bought Barcelona-based startup Vilynx Inc, which specializes in advanced artificial intelligence technology, for $50 million in a move to help the iPhone maker enhance its own AI across a number of apps and services, Bloomberg reported.
According to the report, Apple (AAPL) acquired Vilynx earlier this year. Vilynx has developed technology that uses AI to analyze a video’s visual, audio and text content to understand what the video shows. It uses that technology to create tags for the video, making it searchable. About 50 of the company’s engineers and data scientists will be taken over by Apple, including Vilynx’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Elisenda Bou-Balust.
Apple could potentially apply Vilynx’s technology to the iPhone maker’s digital assistant, Siri, and its search, Bloomberg reported. It could also be used in the company’s Photos app to make video more searchable in a similar fashion to how users can find photos by searching for items inside the photos. Apple could also potentially apply it toward a recommendation engine for its TV and News apps to surface more relevant content to users.
“Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company told Bloomberg.
Apple has in recent years bought up a number of of AI companies, including Xnor.ai, Inductiv and Voysis to boost its AI capabilities.
Ahead of Apple’s FY4Q on Oct.29, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $150 price target, saying that he expects investors to get a glimpse into iPhone demand during this “unprecedented consumer backdrop” and into the demand growth trajectory for iPhone 12 into the holiday quarter and the rest of 2021.
“We believe Apple should post at least modest upside to the Street s $64 billion top-line estimate on the heels of stronger Services revenue and relatively healthy (considering the COVID backdrop) iPhone demand,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. “We also anticipate better than expected bottom-line results compared to Street expectations of $0.71.” (See AAPL stock analysis on TipRanks)
Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on the stock. The Moderate Buy analyst consensus is based on 26 Buys, 8 Holds and only 1 Sell. With shares up 59% year-to-date, the average price target of $ 125.81 implies upside potential of a more moderate 8% to current levels.

Heres What to Expect.,"Text size  The September quarter may seem like the corporate equivalent of a lame duck for Apple, as the final quarter without any contribution to earnings from the newly unveiled iPhone 12 lineup. Investors are focused on demand for the new phones, but the results may still yield some surprises.    Wall Street is busily tweaking its numbers, resulting in a flurry of Monday research notes, before the figures come out late on Thursday. The consensus forecast is for revenue of $64.2 billion and per-share profits of 71 cents.  Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti on Monday assumed coverage of Apple (ticker: AAPL) from one of his colleagues, lifting the firm’s rating to Overweight from Underweight, and setting a price target of $150. At the heart of his call is the idea that it would be a mistake to value Apple like just another tech company.  “Having created an enduring premium consumer electronics brand, we believe that Apple’s product business should be valued in line with other premium and luxury consumer stocks, rather than traditional computer peers,” Bhatti writes. “Apple’s focus on delivering superior user experiences through design, enabled by its unsurpassed silicon to software design capabilities, has resulted in a premium product positioning, differentiating Apple against computing peers.”  Citi’s Jim Suva sees potential upside to consensus estimates driven by iPads, Macs and Wearables, saying “work from home and stay at home trends continued to drive [an] uptick in consumer tech spending during the quarter.” He sees a promising hint in a recent strong earnings report from the peripherals company Logitech (LOGI), which said that iPad accessories were up 144% in the quarter. Suva maintains a Buy rating on the stock and a target of $125 for the share price.  Meanwhile, Cowen’s Krish Sankar repeats his Outperform rating and $133 price target. He thinks September quarter results will be in line with Street estimates, driven by strong demand for iPads and Macs. For the December quarter, he sees sales up 48% sequentially and 5% year over year, with iPhone unit sales hitting 70 million.  “Apple remains one of out top ideas in the hardware space,” he writes.  Raymond James analyst Chris Caso, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, reports that lead times for the iPhone 12 as of Friday had stretched out to 2-3 weeks in all markets other than the U.S., where the phone was available for same-day or next-day pick up in most parts of the country. He echoes other analysts in finding that the iPhone 12 Pro is in tighter supply than the base iPhone 12, noting that Pro models are not available for in-store pickup in the US at this time.  “This is generally consistent with prior launches, where inventories of the higher-end devices are generally lower than the mass market tier,” he writes.  Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryananai also repeats his Outperform rating and $135 price target, while adding a “tactical outperform” element to his call. He says the stock “should keep working higher,” driven by strong demand for hardware other than iPhones, acceleration in the services business, and strong iPhone 12 demand, driven in part by aggressive promotions offered by wireless carriers in the U.S. Apple’s commentary about the December quarter will be more positive than the Street expects when the company reports results on Thursday, he says.  RBC Capital’s Robert Muller also had a bullish note on Apple on Monday, discussing the results of a survey of more than 800 Apple and Android users on their buying intentions.  “We believe the results bode well for Apple’s newly released 5G enabled phones, which we expect will kick off a multi-year upgrade cycle,” he writes. “iPhone users appear quite sticky with 90% of iPhone customers either ‘definitely’ or ‘likely’ to remain in the ecosystem. This compares to just 71% of Android customers. Further, 24% of Android customers are considering an iPhone for this cycle, with 16% considering a switch to a 5G model. The Apple ecosystem remains strong with the average iPhone user owning 1.9 additional Apple products.”  He kept an Outperform rating and $132 price target on Apple shares.  Apple shares are up nearly 60% this year. The S&P 500 is up 5% in 2020.  Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com"

To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool s free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.  This video was recorded on October 23, 2020.  Dylan Lewis: It is Friday, October 23rd, and we are talking about Google s antitrust case, and Snap s big quarter. I m your host Dylan Lewis, and I m joined by Fool.com s sensational straight-shooter of so-so snapshots, Brian Feroldi.  I like that you worked the company name into that one, Brian.  Brian Feroldi: I think I should do that more often, don t you?  Lewis: I think that s a fun bit. Yeah. And I think our listeners are waiting for the day that you trip me up. And if they ever have a suggestion for something, something that is so tongue-twister-y that I won t be able to get through it, you are @Brian Feroldi on Twitter and you are happy to get those suggestions.  Feroldi: Please, I would love naming suggestions, we have to trip-up Dylan. It is a mission that all of us should be on.  Lewis: [laughs] Pretty big story this week in tech, Brian, kind of an unavoidable story, it doesn t even matter if you really follow the industry or the stock market. The fact that the Department of Justice along with 11 state Attorneys General are filing a civil antitrust lawsuit at Google, it kind of dominated headlines and became one of the major stories of the week.  Feroldi: I mean, this certainly isn t our first time that we ve seen governments take legal action against companies like Facebook , Google, Microsoft, etc., fill-in-the-blank tech company there. This one definitely caught my attention. As you pointed out, this has been in 11 different states, and when I see the name Attorney General and antitrust concerns, I always take a look.  Lewis: Yeah, this has been building for a while. And I don t think anyone is surprised by this, it s more that we, kind of, formally know that this is something that s happening now. And this is, kind of, it s long-ly been speculated, I mean, big tech, I think on both sides of the aisle, has been a target, and so it was really just a matter of time before we saw some movement. And we re going to talk a little bit about what the impacts of some of this might be, but I think just to get some of the details down here. The Department of Justice, in this claim, is repeatedly referring to Google as, kind of, the gatekeeper of the internet in this release, and what they re doing is trying to draw comparisons to how Google is acting and the past enforcement of some of the Sherman Act with AT&T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998.  And, Brian, normally I would not read a bunch of legalese on the podcast, [laughs] because I think it could be dry, but I think in this case it s important, because you and I are not going to summarize this any better than the DoJ wind up stating it, they chose their words very carefully. And they allege, that Google has entered into a series of exclusionary agreements that collectively lock up primary avenues through which users access search engines, and thus the internet, by requiring that Google be set as the preset default general search engine on billions of mobile devices and computers worldwide, and in many cases prohibiting preinstallation of a competitor.  And they itemized a couple of things there, they re really looking at the exclusivity agreements that Google has with folks that are in the smartphone space which basically prevent other preinstalled search apps or services from competing. They also look at some of the arrangements of preinstallation with the specific mobile devices that maybe make them undeletable, as well as, some specific long-term agreements with Apple, and of course all of that bundling up into something where this company making a ton of money there are ""monopoly profits,"" according to what they filed, and they use that money to continue to buy preferential treatment for search engine placement on web browsers and in mobile apps.  So, I think the big thing here is how Google is using contracts to lock-in default status. And this shouldn t be a surprise to anyone that has used a smartphone in the last, like, 10 years.  Feroldi: Yeah, Google, I mean, completely dominates search, it also is the search engine, its Android search engine is the default search engine on about 90% of smartphones that exist in the world. No surprise to see that the default search engine on those systems are Google, that is how Google monetizes its platform, and the reason that it can give its operating system away for free, it makes it all up on the backend on search. This is an interesting angle that they re taking here, because it doesn t seem like they re going after the fact that Google is so dominant, what they re alleging here is that Google is signing contracts that forbid other competitors to be able to be used. Not surprisingly, Google shot back against that.  Lewis: [laughs] They did. They certainly have their own opinion. And they will easily point to the fact that there are other players in that space. So, Google pays Apple for relatively prominent placement in Apple devices. And that paycheck varies depending on the year, it s about $8 billion to $12 billion. That is a sizable amount of money, and if you re Apple, that s very high margin revenue. You don t really [laughs] have to do much to fulfill that revenue. And it s a big deal for both of those businesses. But importantly, they say, well, if you pull up a Safari window, you can easily search via Bing, you can easily change your default; which I think is true to some extent. But defaults are so powerful, regardless of whether they are tech or not, but I think particularly with tech, because it s work. Getting outside of whatever your core use is and actually taking the time to adjust settings, it s more than most people are going to do. And it seems like DoJ is really focusing on that, because it creates behavior automatically.  Feroldi: It does, and Google knows that, of course. The reason they pay Apple [laughs] billions of dollars is because they know most consumers won t take the time to switch their default search engine, especially if they re happy with that default setting that s in there. Google points back that they essentially view this as the shelf space of the internet, the same way that when you go to a grocery store the big brands like Kellogg s and General Mills, pay a premium to the grocery stores to have their products be on the most visible shelves, and their competitors are on the lower shelves. Google is alleging the same thing here, and it s hard not to agree with that, because as you just said, any user, at any time can really change these. I mean, myself, while I use Google Chrome as my web browser, my default search engine Ecosia, which is a search engine that plants trees every time I perform a search. So, me as the consumer, I don t see how I am [laughs] harmed by having that option because, again, I m using a Google product to do searches on something else.  Lewis: Yeah. Do you think you re representative though, Brian?  Feroldi: No, I don t think that I m representative, and that s shown by Google s extreme dominance and their 90% market share. One other thing that they point out, which I think is a good point on their behalf, is if you look at mobile, I mean, there s no doubt that Google is the dominant platform there and they pay companies like Apple for that positioning and then there s their Android operating system. If you look at desktop, who dominates there, it s Microsoft. Microsoft really does not want Google to be used. They have all of their default search engine traffic pointed at Bing. Even with that, though, it s pretty clear if you look at the top searches on Bing for what consumers actually want; I actually have them here, and three of the four most popular searches on Bing are YouTube, Google and Gmail. That is [laughs] consumers purposely typing into Bing and saying I want Google products immediately. If that doesn t tell you something about consumer preferences, I don t know what does.  Lewis: Yeah, I think Bing s tag line could be, ""a way to get to Google."" [laughs] But I think that that s, kind of, the messy part of this from an antitrust standpoint, is Google will very quickly point to the fact that they have products that people love, and they are kind of playing this tack of, you re punishing us for being successful and creating things that people enjoy, and I think that s true.  That said, I don t think that people fully grasp some of the other elements that happened with this business that they re able to do because they have such a massive position. And so, they are able to be quite benevolent, [laughs] and, you know, basically give away most of their products, but at the same time we don t have a ton of insight into the data side and the privacy side of the business and I think we re increasingly becoming more and more aware of that. But without really strong competition, and you could argue that a lot of these things inhibit competition, that doesn t have to become a selling point for them, and it puts them in a position of power to basically dictate what the terms of privacy and data are.  Feroldi: It really does, and what s interesting to me, I mean, this is definitely going to be a lawsuit for us to watch, but what s the outcome here? Let s say the DoJ wins, what do they win? Is it that Apple has to make Bing its default search engine or does the government get a piece of the revenue or...? I don t know, if it s like, yes, we can prove all this, what is the outcome aside from Google just cutting the government a multibillion-dollar check like it does [laughs] on a regular basis already. So, that to me is a big question that I don t know the answer to.  And the other thing that I found interesting about this, I mean, this is always worth noting, but the market really seems to shrug this off completely. Again, when I first saw the headline, my first reaction was, this can t be good, but Google stock is up 3.5% this week, so it s very clear [laughs] that the market is basically taking this news with a big yawn.  Lewis: I think we ve known it was coming for a while, and I think maybe that s part of this reaction. What I think is a little curious, Brian, is this has been very focused on distribution and defaults, that s basically DoJ s case, we re looking at how users put these things into their daily life and basically how they make sense of these products, what their choices appear to be when they re using browsers or when they re using phones.  They could have taken a different tack and said, you own Google and YouTube, you own all of these internet properties that effectively give, you know, X percentage of people s online time. And that would seem like something where they re going to start hiving off different business segments, and saying, you know, you can t operate these two different properties, it seems anticompetitive that you own them both. That s not really what I got from reading DoJ s, at least initial release on this.  Feroldi: Yeah. I mean, who knows where this will lead in time, this could be completely nothing or it could turn into, it could lead down the road to Google getting split up, as we ve heard numerous times before, and it s been kind of a risk for investing in any of these big tech companies. When I view news like this, I always take note of it and I always track and follow how these things go, but as investors, there s not much that we know today other than this is in the news, and there s not really much that we can do other than sell our shares. I certainly am not [laughs] going to be selling my Google shares based on this news. And it s also worth remembering that, even if the worst does happen and Google has to pay billions of dollars in fines and get broken up, that might unlock shareholder value, [laughs] as crazy as that is. So, to me, this is a news story that s worth watching, but for right now doing nothing is the thing to do.  Lewis: Yeah. I think what s kind of fascinating about this is, all of the reasons that are being cited for why this is anticompetitive are precisely the reasons why people buy Alphabet stock. You know, you have this property that is massive, it prints money. They are able to bring in so much in ad revenue and they re able to give people a really great product for free. There are catches with that, and I think those catches are at the data and privacy side. But all of the things that make it great and investable are exactly what are, kind of, the points that DoJ is trying to make as an issue.  I think, if there s anyone who maybe isn t happy with the status quo, it s folks that are buying ads on the other side. And so, we think of ourselves as the users of these products and the customers of these products, the reality is, the advertisers are really the customer for a company like Google. And one of the points that s made by DoJ here is, basically with reduced competition Google has pretty much monopolistic control when it comes to what they charge advertisers and what they re willing to offer advertisers in terms of innovation, and that could be construed as anticompetitive. So, this might be something where the financial harm element of the case looks a lot more at the advertisers  side of the business than the consumer side of the business, it s hard to make that case when you are giving away a product for free.  Feroldi: Yeah. And it s also worth pointing out that when the antitrust laws were written, Geesh! I think almost 90 years ago at this point, tech companies like this didn t exist. I mean, how could they foresee that there would be companies out there that would be giving away their products for free to consumers, like, that would be like something that they couldn t even imagine. I could see the government having a hard time using laws that were written 90 years ago against companies like this. So, it might be the case that noise like this keeps coming up, which necessitates the need for more updated antitrust laws, but again, that s all speculation, who knows what s going to happen.  Lewis: Yeah. It s not the conventional price gouging vertical integration, we own all the distribution so you have to pay it type antitrust thing, which is difficult. And, Brian, I think we often look at news and we say, we don t really know what to do with this. We like the thesis of this business and it s hard to really understand how this is going to impact it, you know, we re going to hold onto our shares. If you want a historical example of why that s a helpful way to look at these things look at the last major antitrust case, you know, look at Microsoft. They were firmly in DoJ s crosshairs and wound up being a landmark case in the late  90s, early 2000s, that company has performed just fine over the last 20 years. There s a period where the stock didn t really do a lot, that wasn t really because of the antitrust case, that was because of management. If you bought at the peak, right before a lot of the antitrust stuff came to roost, you would still be sitting on some pretty great gains.  Feroldi: And the amazing thing about this is, there s an argument to be made that this antitrust suit, if it goes through, could directly help Microsoft s [laughs] product to become more powerful in the search market. So, yeah, history loves irony apparently.  Lewis: [laughs] All right. We re going to take story No. 2, also staying in the internet property realm with this one, Brian, and that is Snap s earnings release. I think, if people have listened to the show and haven t really been following Snap, they would think that this business is not doing particularly well. We have not touched on it very much, but early on, went through their prospectus and some of their early earnings releases, we re pretty unimpressed. And very quietly this has become [laughs] a very good performing company.  Feroldi: It really has. I mean, this stock is up 159% year-to-date, it has rallied sharply off of its 2019 lows, and earlier this week it reported earnings and jumped 30%. I was shocked to see this, but this, Snap, is actually beating the market since it came public. As you said, I specifically remember the episode that you and Evan Niu did, diving deep into this company. And I was also thoroughly unimpressed with this business, especially compared to the alternative social networks, like Pinterest, like Facebook, so I just completely wrote this company off. Well, apparently, we shouldn t do that, because this business is now a market-beater.  Lewis: Yeah, I was shocked to hear that, because I was like, OK, well, you know, they re up, but they at one point were trading in the single digits; I think, their shares were around $5 or $6. So, you know, they re probably on some decent gains, but there s no way they re back well above their IPO price or at the point where they re beating the S&P, but that s really how successful this business has been. Why don t we unpack some of the numbers then we can, kind of, get into what we expected with this company versus what we ve seen?  Feroldi: So, the big takeaway here is daily active users; that s the metric that most investors look at and pay attention to. In the most recent quarter that figure grew 18% to $249 million; and that number was growth across the world, North America is their most mature market and the growth there was about 7% in Europe, it was growth of about 10%.  The big one here is the international news, we saw the rest of the world, which that s just all called, it s called the rest of the world, but users grew 43% everywhere else in the world to 87 million. One thing that they noted on the call was that TikTok was actually banned in India in June, and they saw that they saw a particularly strong growth in India in June. But the big headline there is 18% growth in users; that s impressive.  Lewis: Yeah, the interesting thing with this business has been, like, what do they do and what does their North American segment look like long-term, because as you mentioned before, it s one of their more mature markets. They re not really enjoying blistering user growth there. And for folks that have heard us talk about any of the social media companies, the North American segment is so priced for all of these companies, because that s where the Average Revenue Per User is going to be the highest. It s the most dominant market in terms of ad spend, consumer spending is high and there s just a lot of disposable income, and so that drives high ad spend. Quarter-over-quarter they didn t grow that number in North America. They re growing in the low-single-digits mid-single-digits year-over-year. I ve always wondered if Snap is going to be able to make that jump that Facebook did from being something that kids like, you know, college kids like, to being something that literally everyone is on. It doesn t seem like that s coming together, but they ve proven that [laughs] they can make a lot of money even without going from what we call like that sub-millennial group; is that Gen Z, Brian, is that what that group is?  Feroldi: Yeah, I believe so. And yeah, that was my big question with this company too. Snap seems to have done a really good job with teenagers who, I guess, now at this point are in their young 20s, and they really seem to dominate in that market, but that s not where a lot of the spending is. So, to me, it always seemed like a really niche product and they struggle to grow outside that number. As you pointed out, they re still not really growing that fast in North America, but it s clear that this platform resonates with age groups all across the world. If you were to tell me that this business could have 250 million monthly active users by now, I probably wouldn t believe you.  Lewis: Yeah. And another part of the story that I think we are skeptical of early on was their monetization efforts, knowing that they were going to be, you know, generally appealing to a younger audience. I don t know that their ARPU stacks up to some of the other major social media players in an impressive way right now, but they ve been able to meaningfully grow their topline, and some of that has been, they switched over to programmatic and had some ugly results related to that, but then that gave them the scale with their platform that allowed them to post some really impressive revenue growth. And in this most recent quarter, revenue up over 50% to almost $700 million, and that is their fastest growth in two years. So, they re clearly doing something right with the platform and the way that they ve introduced monetization.  Feroldi: Yeah. So, 52% revenue growth. They absolutely crushed Wall Street s estimates by over $100 million. And that 52% growth was actually a really strong acceleration from the prior quarter, which only showed 17% revenue growth. Now, the delta between that 52% revenue growth and 18% growth in users is, what you just said, ARPU, Average Revenue Per User, that figure jumped 28% worldwide to $2.73; that s a key metric for investors to watch with social media platforms like this. And clearly, they re able to squeeze more revenue out of each of their users, while at the same time they re growing their user base.  Now, one of the things that I thought before was that they were a niche player, that they weren t going to grow that much and their financials, when they first came public, were dreadful. I mean, gross margin was low, the net loss on this business was horrific, stock-based compensation was really high, they had a huge dependence on Amazon Web Services, so their platform wasn t scalable. I mean, pick a metric and I was like, no, this is not what you want to see. Their recent numbers prove that they re starting to overcome all of that. So, not only did revenue grow 52%, but gross margin expanded from 51% to 58% this quarter; given their dependence on AWS, I didn t think that that was possible, so kudos for them for getting it done.  Lewis: Yeah, I m surprised by that. And for folks that maybe need a quick refresher, they don t own their infrastructure, they wind up, basically, outsourcing their cloud stuff to AWS. And what that does is it puts them in, kind of, an asset-light model, where they don t have to put all of these upfront costs into making sure that they can deliver to their users. What it also means is that they don t control the costs and really enjoy leverage in the same way. And so, they pay for usage and it turns what would be an upfront fixed cost into a variable cost. And so, you don t enjoy leverage in the same way. But I guess that they ve gotten to the point where they re using enough, they re a big enough contract, that they re able to go back to AWS, which is impressive, and say, you know, we want slightly better terms on this contract.  Feroldi: Yeah, that s the benefit of scale, you can do that. Now, is this ever going to get to Facebook s level of margins? Probably not. But even if you can make a business out of 60% or 58%, low 60%s, grow margin for sure. What was also impressive here, is that, if you squint and looked very carefully, you actually saw that the company was ""profitable"" on a non-GAAP basis. So, they actually reported a non-GAAP net income of $0.01/share, that was better than the $0.04/share loss that was brought in last year, but it was much better than the $0.05 net loss that analysts were expecting.  Now, that s a very low quality profitability number, because free cash flow here was still -$72 million, they had $192 million in quarterly stock-based compensation quarterly, so they continue to dole out shares like crazy, but they also have $2.7 billion in cash, so they can continue to fund these losses. And if they can continue to grow at this rate and expand margins, they could be legitimately profitable in the not too distant future.  Lewis: Yeah, there are some interesting things with this company s financials for as many things [laughs] as are moving in the right direction, you know, over 50% margins, you would think that that winds up creating a profitable business fairly soon. And yet, you look at their spend and it raises some eyebrows. So, they did over $1 billion in gross profit over the last 12 months, Brian. They wound up posting an operating income loss of over $900 million. And you dig into the individual expenses there, over $1 billion in SG&A and over $1 billion in R&D. That s a lot of money to be spending in R&D. And I don t know that we ve seen anything that is necessarily worthy of that spend from this company yet.  Feroldi: Well, clearly, the management team here believes that their platform isn t just a niche player and they re really going after -- they think that they can go after -- an even larger opportunity, that is the story as it s coming today. I mean, given this company s valuation today, they re trading at something like 25X, about 26X sales at this point, you are still betting on not only will the user base grow but they re going to squeeze more and more revenue out of each of their customers. Can they do it? I mean, we ll just have to see.  Lewis: [laughs] I think that there is definitely room for them to expand and grow by basically getting more juice for their squeeze, by making that ARPU number rise over time, there are variety of ways to do that, some of that s going to be ad load, some of that is going to be proving to advertisers that the spend is worthwhile and it s effective and that should cause ad prices to rise over time if that s true. What does become hard though is, I think a lot of that R&D is them looking beyond their current scope. And I ve never really been convinced that they have a good vision for that, you know. They continue to be this camera company, and that s the line that they come back to a lot, they focus on it on their earnings release.  They do a lot in AR. I haven t really been convinced that the spend that they ve done with spectacles and these kinds of things is money well spent. And I think to buy this company at this valuation, you really have to believe in Evan Spiegel.  Feroldi: I think you do. And at least historically, they have been a pretty innovative company. I mean, whenever they come up with an innovation, Facebook pretty much copies it immediately and then makes a ton of money on it. But the thing that stood out to me here that I think is exciting to me about Snapchat is what you just said, they are investing heavily in augmented reality, they are really big believers in this. And just within this quarter they ve rolled out a couple of features that I think are pretty interesting. So, they have partnered with a whole bunch of companies, like Champs Sports, Kohl s, Levi, the Jordan brand, that will enable those brands to have their users ""try on"" apparel and footwear features while they re wearing at home, that s a feature that we ve seen work successfully at makeup companies, for example. And I could see, if I was in charge of the Jordan brand, using Snapchat to check out how Jordans looked on my feet, and then seamlessly going from there to buying them through Snapchat s platform. So, the AR investments are a longshot, but if AR can do what it could potentially do, that could be a major avenue for this company for the long term.  Lewis: I think that s particularly interesting given what we re dealing with right now, Brian. You know, we ve, kind of, long speculated about what bringing digital into retail looks like. And you see some renderings of, like, fancy mirrors in stores where you can, kind of, digitally try on stuff without even having to try it on; by kind of having it just augmented reality, kind of, plant it onto you. The idea of being able to try fits from home in a position where you can t go to the store is a [laughs] pretty compelling offering beyond just the core advertising elements and I could see a lot of these bets paying off, they just seem like really, really big bets.  Feroldi: They certainly are. And kudos to Snap for having that conviction and investing there. Like I said, if AR takes off, the growth estimates for augmented reality technology are just absurdly big over the next 10 years. If Snapchat can be a leading provider of that backend technology, that could be a substantial business for this company. And let s turn to guidance for a second, because the company did actually offer some bullish guidance for the fourth quarter; that, I think, in part help to justify the rally this week, so management thinks that they re going to continue to grow their average users by another 18% in the upcoming quarter to get to 257 million, they didn t give specific revenue guidance but they said that 50% revenue growth year-over-year in the next quarter is attainable. And CFO also said that their goal is still to get to GAAP profitability and positive free cash flow. When you add up all of that I understand the enthusiasm for this company right now.  Lewis: I m curious, Brian, because you are a Pinterest shareholder and I think a pretty strong bull on Pinterest. Is that a fair way to characterize it?  Feroldi: [laughs] Yes, a fair way to characterize it.  Lewis: [laughs] And I think in a lot of ways the story is pretty similar with these two companies, where they have a loyal base of users that s sizable, but it s not on the scale of, say, Facebook or Instagram in North America. A huge part of the thesis for both companies is, we are going to be able to monetize that group well, we re early on in our monetization efforts. Are you starting to see Snapchat look a little bit more like the Pinterest that you like, is this becoming a more investable idea to you?  Feroldi: It s definitely becoming a more investable idea. I will say, between Pinterest, Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook, Snapchat is still my least [laughs] favorite idea of those three, and I m an investor in Facebook, I am also an investor in Pinterest, so I don t see the need to add Snapchat to my personal portfolio. To your point, the thesis for both Snapchat and Pinterest is pretty similar, the thesis is, these platforms are being discounted by the market, we think that they can grow bigger, and most importantly, we believe that they can grow their Average Revenue Per User much, much higher than it is today. We re seeing clear signs of that with both platforms, but if I was to bet on one for the long term, no doubt in my mind it would be Pinterest.  Lewis: And some of that, you know, just kind of comes down to what you use. Like, a big part of investing in this kind of space is, do you believe in the platform, do you like the platform? And you can hear someone talk about how something is great, but if it s not something that you can use and really wrap your head around, it s hard to get onboard with that thesis.  Feroldi: That s correct. And I just think that Pinterest s platform is much more monetizable than Snapchat s platform is. You go to Snapchat to communicate with your friends to send each other images, why do you go to Pinterest? You go to Pinterest to search for things visually. You go there because you have an idea, you don t know what it is, and when you see a certain picture you are inspired to take action, that to me, is far more monetizable, just the roots of the platform, than Snapchat is. So, for that reason alone I ll bet on it, never mind the fact that Pinterest is cash flow positive and reaches possibility and doesn t have obscene stock-based compensation.  Lewis: You know, Brian, as someone who is currently planning some home renovations, I can tell you that s 100% correct. That is why people go to Pinterest, you create boards based on stuff that you want to buy and if you can put stuff in front of people when they re already in that attitude, it s very compelling. One of the other things that I ve kind of wondered about with Snap and still haven t really gotten a good feel for is just, is this something that people will stick around with? I think with Pinterest, you build a board and you are coming back to ideas, and the recommendations within those probably get stronger the more that you use them. With Facebook, you have the strong network effect of people posting content there, and that content living there, being able to revisit that content, kind of the same thing with Twitter to some extent too.  A big part of Snap s story was the ephemeral messaging, and because something disappears there isn t the residue of, you know, being able to go back and revisit it. And so, I ve always wondered whether, if something else comes along, that would be able to sustain their user base? It seems like even with Instagram and Facebook [laughs] shamelessly stealing some of their features, they ve been able to keep their core audience happy, but maybe just not grow it.  Feroldi: Yeah, I think so. I think that s right. And by the way, we should also point out that the love that Snapchat received this week did spill over to Pinterest. Pinterest shareholders also had a really good week based on this. The thesis being, well, Snapchat [laughs] is doing this good in online advertising, Pinterest must be following suit. One other thing that I find interesting is, if you buy my thesis there that Pinterest is the more attractive platform than Snapchat, Pinterest market cap, $30 billion; Snapchat, $60 billion.  Lewis: Yeah, it s kind of wild. And I lost track of the stock for a while, because I, honestly, kind of, written it off and this is, kind of, a mea culpa episode, I think, for me where they ve proven to do a lot of things very well, so much of the valuation still hinges on I think what they could be. I still have concerns with their financials. I think Pinterest is a safer bet in the space. But I wonder if those R&D bets pay off and that spend comes down, there s a profitable business here at some point. And that becomes pretty interesting, because we re seeing that we re not appropriately valuing the revenue per user potential for some of these platforms. And when you look at the likes of some of the more mature ones, there s a big number out there if you can reach it.  Feroldi: Yeah. And one other thing, I just want to double-click on something else you said before that was also a concern that I had about Snapchat in the first place. Snapchat s users tend to be teens and tweens and they have proven to be far more loyal to this platform than I thought they would be. I thought that they would have abandoned this already for the next kind of great thing. Almost the same way you look at, like, what s the latest teen clothing brand of the day and will it be the same popular brand five years from now. Snapchat has proven to be far more resilient in that respect than I thought it was going to be, and if they can continue to maintain that you could easily see this being a highly profitable business in time.  We also got some data this week from Piper Sandler, they did a research on talking stock with teens and asked them about their favorite platforms. Instagram came in at No. 3. TikTok came in at No. 2. No. 1, Snapchat; good for them.  Lewis: Good for them. [laughs] And you know, this is one where I m like, I m rooting for you guys, this is fun to watch. [laughs] You know, like, I think it s nice to just see it as a turnaround story and see a company really get traction. I think there are easier ideas out there and ones that aren t quite as precarious, but good on Snap for getting the story and really just to turn it around; I think they ve done a fantastic job over the last couple of months.  Feroldi: Yep. This is a far more interesting and durable business and I think we first assumed, and good for you if you ve bought Snap and believed in the story at all from the beginning, because you have definitely gotten market-beating returns today.  Lewis: Yeah. I think this emphasizes, Brian, we don t always get it right. In fact, we are probably right about half the time. [laughs]  Feroldi: And if we could be right exactly half the time, that s a great track record.  Lewis: [laughs] I like to think that -- maybe not with investing, Brian, but with a lot of other things, you re right more than half the time, and I m always happy to have you on the show. Thanks for joining me today.  Feroldi: Always fun to be here, Dylan.  Lewis: Listeners, that s going to do it for this episode of Industry Focus.

36,2020-10-28,03:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-europe-still-don-t-070014499.html,The U.S. and Europe Still Dont See Eye to Eye on Big Tech,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s tempting to imagine that the U.S. is finally catching up with Europe when it comes to skepticism — and regulation — of Big Tech.
The reality is different. While the Department of Justice is now pursuing a lawsuit against Google parent Alphabet Inc., and a House panel has proposed reforms to curb the power of Silicon Valley’s biggest firms, the European Union’s tackling of Big Tech is at a very different stage in its evolution. But ploughing too far ahead of the U.S. may be risky.
It’s useful to consider tech antitrust regulation in two acts. In the first, authorities seek to use tools already at their disposal to correct companies’ worst excesses. Should this prove ineffective, lawmakers can then move to the second act and seek to strengthen these tools by updating antitrust laws.
In the EU, the first act has played out over the past decade, as the region’s antitrust police have leaned on existing tools to impose so-called behavioral remedies, which aim to stop discrete anti-competitive practices: fines totaling 8.2 billion euros ($9.7 billion) on Google for monopolistic misbehavior in e-commerce, search and mobile operating systems; and an injunction seeking back taxes from Apple Inc. Further probes into Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. are well underway.
Despite those efforts, Big Tech’s dominance of online advertising and e-commerce continues seemingly unabated. It is perhaps too early to say that behavioral remedies have failed to keep the firms in check. But the European Commission, the bloc’s civil service, is pulling together a set of proposals which, if approved by the European Parliament, would give it expanded regulatory powers to tackle so-called “gate-keeping” platforms and may include the ability to force company breakups. They could arrive by the end of the year and be considered by parliament in 2021. In short, Europe is nearing the end of the first act and is about to embark upon the second.
QuicktakeThe New Tools the EU Wants to Crack Down on Big Tech
The U.S. has meanwhile only just lifted the curtain on Act I. The Justice Department’s case against Google and the Federal Trade Commission’s impending decision on whether to bring a lawsuit against Facebook have, admittedly, the potential to be more blockbuster than anything the EU has managed to achieve. The DOJ has already intimated that it is open to considering so-called structural remedies, which can be further-reaching than behavioral ones. An extreme example would be precipitating Google to separate or divest part of its business.
Even so, the Google and Facebook cases (should the latter materialize) are both likely to take years. And proposals from the House subcommittee to update antitrust laws seem a long way from graduating to a bill, let alone an act. While the DOJ case may have bipartisan support, changing antitrust laws does not, unlike in Europe. If the cases prove successful in reining in the tech giants, it’d be easy to argue that the current tools are adequate, and therefore new laws aren’t required. Indeed, the cases might be an effort to preempt the need for new legislation, according to Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law at the European University Institute and the author of “Big Tech and the Digital Economy: The Moligopoly Scenario.”
As the EU proceeds irrespectively with plans for a new antitrust toolbox, antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and her cohort will have to make difficult choices about whether and how to use those new powers. Don’t get me wrong: Strengthening European regulators may well be desirable and prompt the tech giants to think more carefully about their actions.
Although it may appear that Europe and the U.S. are now singing from the same hymn sheet, there is a subtle discord. Any perceived European overreach could set the two regions on a collision course.

This Is What You Need to Know,"Apple (AAPL) will report FQ4 earnings on Thursday evening in what will as per usual be one of earnings season’s highlights. This September quarter’s results, however, will have a different flavor, due to the well-publicized delay to the new iPhone’s release. An issue Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong believes will be on investors’ minds when Apple releases its quarterly financial results.
“We expect a solid Sept-qtr report from AAPL, but see investors overlooking any recent strength/weakness and focusing on the Dec-qtr given the recent iPhone release and impact on guidance and the Mar-qtr beyond, as this is the first time that all new iPhone products are a month or more delayed. With only a week of new iPhone sales by the time earnings are reported on 10/29, we are unsure that AAPL will feel comfortable with guidance,” Ong wrote.
In fact, Apple has not provided any official guidance since January, while for the December quarter, the tech giant usually has 1.5 months of sales data to base the guidance on, it is a luxury the company does not have this time around.
As for the September quarter’s results, Ong expects revenue of $62.7 billion, indicating a 5% quarter-over-quarter uptick yet down by 2% year-over-year. The Street’s forecast calls for $63.8 billion. Ong’s EPS estimate stands at $0.69 compared to the Street’s $0.70 estimate.
In contrast to Apple, Ong does provide guidance for the next quarter and expects revenue to increase by 9% year-over-year and 60% quarter-over-quarter to $100.1 billion, slightly below the Street’s call for $100.6 billion. On the bottom line, Ong expects EPS of $1.37, the same as the Street’s estimate.
As a side note, the 5-year average quarter-over-quarter increase for revenue in the Dec Quarter stands at 52%. “Given the lack of 1 week of new iPhone revenues in the Sept-qtr due to the delayed release, we would expect AAPL to beat seasonality comfortably in the Dec-qtr,” Ong added.
All in all, ahead of the print, Ong reiterates a Buy rating on AAPL shares along with a $140 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Ong’s track record, click here)
Apple has decent support on the Street with 26 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell coalescing to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $125.81, the average price target suggests room for an 8% uptick. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks)

There have now been $110 billion of deals announced in the semiconductor industry this year, led by Nvidia Corp.’s $40 billion bid for Cambridge, England-based chip designer Arm, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Xilinx deal makes 2020 the biggest year at this point on record for pending and completed deals involving semiconductors, the data show.
The highwater mark for semiconductor deals was reached in 2016, when $122 billion in transactions were struck for the entire year. If acquisitions continue at the current pace, 2020 will easily top that level. The largest deal of 2016 was SoftBank Group Corp.’s $24 billion purchase of Arm.
Competition in the semiconductor industry is heating up as companies that were once customers, such as Apple Inc., design their own chips and established players like Nvidia branch out into new areas.
One adviser estimates that there are about 75 public chip companies now and that number could be cut in half because of consolidation in the next few years.

With the Arm deal, Nvidia gets access to semiconductor designs that are in most smartphones and licenses for chips that run thousands of appliances known as the Internet of Things.
Buying San Francisco-based Xilinx gives AMD access to programmable chips for wireless telecommunication networks ahead of phone carriers’ plans to build out high-speed fifth-generation mobile networks. It also helps the company expand further in the profitable market for data-center computer components, currently dominated by Intel Corp.
Earlier this month, Intel agreed to sell its Nand memory unit to South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. for about $9 billion.
These rivalries have made the industry stand out in an otherwise sluggish deal market. Globally, mergers and acquisitions in all sectors are down roughly 23% to about $1.9 trillion from the same period last year, Bloomberg data show.

The company said it has a multi-year deal with the comedian, but didn’t mention how many episodes each season of the series will include."

On the one hand, there is the fear of missing out on more returns in the equity market. On the other, is elevated anxiety about the outcome and aftermath of the election and what that will do to their portfolios. Those are among the key takeaways from our recent survey of Investopedia readers, the fifth we have conducted since before the coronavirus was named a global pandemic.  Caught in the Neutral Zone  While our readers are slightly less bullish than they were in August, they are also slightly less bearish than they were in the summer. Since then, economies have opened up and growth is strong across most industries – although the labor market remains compromised – yet the virus is still very present in everyday life. Equity markets have trudged higher after rebounding out of the fastest bear market in history, and that has caused some concerns about stretched valuations in some stocks and sectors.  The Election is the Overhang  The upcoming election remains the dominant concern among our readers. While they are split on who they think will win the election, they remain concerned about the impact it will have on their portfolios. They are also concerned about what will happen in the aftermath of the election and whether it will be contested and peaceful.  Staying the Course  Despite their worries, only one quarter of our survey respondents, who range in age and income across the U.S., are making changes to their portfolios. Most are sticking with the stocks and strategies that have carried them through this tumultuous year. Their favorite stocks (listed below) show that they have chosen wisely and safely.  Millennials are significantly more likely than boomers to say they re making big changes to their investments based on recent market events (25% vs 15). Among those making changes, Millennials are more likely to be investing more (45% of Millennials responding to the market say they re investing more money vs 18% of Boomers). They re also going riskier. 31% of Millennials making changes say they re moving into riskier investments vs 13% of Boomers).  Too Far, Too Fast?  62% of our survey respondents, regardless of age, think the stock market has become overvalued. 71% believe that the economy and the stock market are disconnected and 54% anticipate it could experience another significant drop in the next three months. The reasons for that are as described: The election, its aftermath, and the possibility of another economic shutdown.  They are also slightly concerned about President Trump’s use of social media as a communications tool and its impact on the stock market, as well as his health and the health of his administration. We fielded the survey just as the president tested positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently hospitalized.  Investors Keep the Faith in Their Favorite Stocks  Our readers have proven to be faithful investors when it comes to their portfolios. The top 10 holdings have remained fairly consistent throughout the pandemic, although there is variation among the different age groups of our readers. But the top three holdings – Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) – are also among the most widely held stocks in index funds, ETFs, hedge funds, endowments, and among retail investors.  Millennials are even more likely to favor IT (49% vs 41% among Boomers) and Boomers are even more likely to favor healthcare (19% vs 12% millennials).  Older investors have held onto their favorite dividend paying stocks like Bank of America (BAC) and Verizon (VZ), as well as traditional media companies like Disney (DIS). Tesla (TSLA) investors are nothing if not loyal and they have stuck with the electric car maker through many peaks and valleys, although 2020 has mostly been peaks.  What’s Next?  The next few months are a big question mark for investors. The election is the obvious elephant in the room, but beyond that, the resurgence of the virus and another potential lockdown, concerns about social unrest, and the widening disconnect between the capital markets and the economy will cloud the horizon. Individual investors, like our readers, have different time horizons and goals for investing than institutional investors. They can mostly afford to be patient until the smoke clears on any one or all of those issues. Until then, expect them to stay in the neutral zone."

LOS ANGELES, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart will host and produce a new current affairs series for Apple Inc s streaming television service, the company announced on Tuesday.
The multi-season series on Apple TV+ will bring the comedian back to TV on a regular basis for the first time since he ended his Emmy-winning run as host of ""The Daily Show"" in 2015.
No debut date for the untitled series was announced. Apple said in a statement that each one-hour episode would address a single issue and explore topics related to current events and Stewart s advocacy work.
The issues also will be discussed in a companion podcast, the company said.
Stewart’s irreverent brand of political and media satire made him a beloved figure on television with influence far beyond the 2 to 3 million nightly audience of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central.
Since leaving the ""Daily Show,"" Stewart has appeared occasionally on talk shows and this year released a political comedy film called ""Irresistible"" that he wrote and directed.
He also has advocated for wounded veterans and for healthcare benefits for first responders who became ill after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He and his wife, Tracey, opened a farm sanctuary in New Jersey.
Stewart s new series is part of a multi-year agreement with Apple to develop and produce projects for Apple TV+, a $5-a-month competitor to subscription video services from companies such as Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co ."

Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter results demonstrating that the company is strong, financially healthy and well positioned for growth. Sales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially. EPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43, as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year.  We generated $518 million of free cash flow and finished the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash. Our financial performance has improved significantly since April, and we expect a strong fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant and continue to adapt appropriately to multiple disruptive forces playing out around the world from the pandemic, the civil unrest to recession and geopolitical struggles. We ve been rising to the challenges since day one, and our priorities remain clear.  First, we must make our values evident in our actions. Our commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees underlines every facet of our operations. We re dedicating resources and providing leadership to support our communities around the world. We ve launched Unity campaigns as well as racial and social equality programs targeting the multitude of hardships people are confronting right now.  And when it comes to the global health fight, we re all in, mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus directly. We must also safeguard our financial health. Our third-quarter results show that our decisive actions are providing clear benefits as we leverage cost savings and increase efficiencies across the company. Regardless of the depth or duration of global uncertainty, we re doing everything in our power to keep the company strong, and it s working.  Now to ensure that we emerge even stronger, we re continuing to invest to create additional revenue streams. We re inventing new-to-the-world materials and manufacturing processes as well as co-innovating new solutions in partnership with our customers. The relevance of our portfolio puts Corning at the heart of ongoing innovation with industry leaders, and we continue to solve our customers  toughest technology challenges. You may have seen Apple s recent promotion of ceramic shield for the iPhone 12.  Their featuring are new-to-the-world material, which is the world s first, highly transparent color-free glass ceramic with performance that meets the rigorous demands put on smartphone cover materials. This latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of consistent, long-term value creation by combining our deep expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities. Ceramic shield melds the attributes that we love about glass, create optics and retain strength with the attributes we love about ceramics, most notably, it s toughness. Ceramics shield consist of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix.  There were two big inventions here. The first was keeping the best damage-resistant attributes of both glass and ceramics. The second was ensuring high optical transparency by growing index-matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of late. As you recall, Apple made two investments in Corning, totaling $450 million, as part of their advanced manufacturing fund and their commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers.  We thank Apple for our long-standing product development partnership and their investments in new manufacturing technology centered in our Harrisburg, Kentucky facility. We could not be prouder to be a key component in the iPhone 12. Now, it s important to note the iPhone 12, and many other flagship phones that we are also proud to be part of, support 5G. 5G matters to us.  The density of fiber necessary to deliver its promise is yet another example. You ve seen us illustrate that up to 100x more fiber is required to deploy 5G in a city than 4G. This week, we announced a new product design to help operators dramatically boost the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments. And we re embarking on new work to support Verizon s efforts to extend 5G indoors.  The relevance of our portfolio and our deep customer relationships, as illustrated by these advancements, keep us at the center of the inexorable shift to optical. Stepping back, in all the industries we serve, important market trends offer new challenges. The Corning is uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products. This is an especially powerful value creation lever in times of economic uncertainty, because we aren t exclusively relying on people buying more stuff.  We re putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. We are clearly seeing the benefits of this lever in today s results as innovation adoption drove specialty materials sales up 23% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market. This type of outperformance is not unique. From 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales, or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down.  And we re extending that growth streak this year. In environmental technologies, we grew sales 16% in 2019, much faster than the underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars. And we, again, saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales up 68%. These are additional examples of the more Corning strategy at work and why the content story is so powerful for us.  I want to stress one additional point. You often hear us say that our core technologies enable life-changing capabilities. In these times, we re increasing focus on life-saving innovations. Safe widespread vaccine delivery is one of society s top priorities, and glass packaging is critical.  Our Valor innovation will help enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. Right now, we re expanding capacity and supplying glass vials for vaccines as part of operation work speed, all while leveraging our leadership in life sciences to help support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts. Additionally, reduced fine particulate pollution, the objective of our filtration products, appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. And we re excited about recent university lab test, showing that our guardian antimicrobial glass particles, kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-COV2.  We re also well-positioned to contribute as consumers continue to adapt to a world with social distancing. For example, fiber increases the capacity and performance of networks, and glass provides the primary window to information and entertainment. We re confident that we can bring further innovations to bear in many vital areas as the world addresses and recovers from these current challenges. Overall, we had a very strong quarter on almost every dimension.  From an innovation perspective, I just reviewed our significant advancements. Financially, we grew sales at double-digit rate sequentially and expanded margins to grow profitability even faster. Operationally, we performed well, and I d like to share a few examples. In the midst of the pandemic, we deployed expert engineering teams to start-up our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou.  These facilities are positioning on us well to capture the fast-growing demand for large TVs. In mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a new-to-the-world manufacturing process and product to meet Apple s iPhone launch. In automotive, we flexed our operations to adjust to the fast pace ramp-up at OEMs after they significantly reduced production in Quarter 2. In optical communications, we successfully adjusted our cost to the current market environment, resulting in significant profitability expansion, despite flattish sales, on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  We also remain vigilant in our actions to safeguard the company s financial strength. We re proud of our execution, especially given the current global uncertainties. Clearly, our employees around the world are dedicated to living our values and giving their best every day. Now, I ll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insights on the quarter.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter. As Wendell highlighted, we executed effectively, and we bolstered our healthy balance sheet despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Sales growth and cost actions led to strong sequential margin expansion, further demonstrating that our operational adjustments are working.  We ve made significant adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with the lower anticipated sales. In total, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to deliver on our commitments and extend our leadership as we continue to focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation, and prudent capital allocation. Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to call out the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and cover the differences between GAAP and core results. On September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor group redeemed DuPont s 40.25% ownership interest in the company, which transformed Corning s longtime ownership in Hemlock into a majority position.  In the second transaction, Hemlock purchased certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a critical raw material, thereby becoming a leading, low-cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon to the semiconductor industry. Hemlock s leadership position is backed by attractive the long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments. Now, we re very excited about these transactions. They are good for Hemlock, good for Corning, and good for our shareholders.  We didn t put any money into the transaction, and Hemlock generates a lot of cash so its debt is mostly paid back in one year. Corning improves its financials by adding sales and earnings. In the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock. And Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow.  Please see our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details. Now on to GAAP. The largest differences between our third-quarter GAAP and core results are a noncash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash, and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. Now with respect to the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.  We re very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We ve received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since our inception more than five years ago. Now, I ll walk through our third quarter performance. At the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger.  In Q1 and Q2, we told you we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments. We said we reduced cost and capital spend to align with lower anticipated sales. And while ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expect improved profitability. Now, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% -- sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion, and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially, to 18.3%.  This resulted in net income of $380 million and EPS of $0.43, up 72% sequentially. We also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. In the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $518 million, cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall.  As a result, I m confident that we will succeed on our free cash flow goals. These actions -- the actions we re taking are clearly working. We have delivered great operational improvements, which started to show results in Q2, and really accelerated in Q3. We expect the benefit of these actions to continue in Q4, contributing to another strong quarter.  Now, let s review the business segments. In display technologies, third quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially, and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially. Display glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially, as panel makers increase utilization, resulting in strong incrementals. Sequential price declines were moderate, as expected.  From an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact from COVID-19 has been a positive. In developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment. Globally, work and study from home trends are growing. This is increasing demand for TV and IT products.  On the other hand, smartphone demand has been down. In total, the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, is up mid-single digits year-to-date through August. Of course, the upcoming holiday retail season will be a big factor in how the market actually plays out for the full year. Longer term, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow.  TVs at 65 inches or larger grew 40% year-to-date through August. And we are well positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. We continue to expect display pricing to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment: First, we expect glass supply/demand to be balanced to tight.  For Corning, we are ramping our Gen 10.5 tanks to align with panel makers  schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.  In optical communications, third-quarter sales grew 10% sequentially to $909 million, as carrier spending and deployments remain stable and enterprise sales grew slightly. Net income grew by $34 million or 42% to $115 million, driven by improving cost performance. Looking forward, demand on the network is at an all-time high, and we are seeing positive statements on capacity expansion from network operators. Currently, COVID-related factors hampered the ability to invest broadly in networks, and operators are focusing efforts on addressing capacity bottlenecks.  We believe operators will begin additional investments to reestablish normal network headroom and expand offerings. Large-carrier and enterprise capital projects are inevitable. But as we ve said before, it s always hard to predict the timing. Environmental technology sales in the third quarter were $379 million, up 68% sequentially as markets recovered and OEMs continued to adopt GPS in Europe and China.  We effectively adjusted our operations to pace with the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million, compared to breakeven in the second quarter. The business team did a great job over the last six months in reacting to the rapid shutdown and restart of auto production by controlling cost and maintaining flexibility. Automotive sales increased 1% year-over-year as continued strong adoption of GPS helped us exceed vehicle production, which declined 6% year over year. In the quarter, we saw continued strong market performance in China, up slightly year over year.  North America and European OEMs more than doubled production sequentially, but declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Diesel sales improved 49% from the second quarter, but we re still down 15% year-over-year. The North American heavy-duty truck market improved, but remains in a cyclical downturn with vehicle production down 46% year-over-year. Third-quarter sales of heavy-duty vehicles in China, however, continue to exceed 2019 levels, and adoption of advanced content increased in preparation for China 6 regulations.  No doubt, this has been a challenging year for our automotive market access platform. However, we are recovering faster than the market due to increasing content, primarily GPS and advanced heavy-duty products. Our content-driven strategy continues to drive strong results. Specialty materials sales were $570 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market, which declined.  Net income grew 59% year over year to $146 million. Sales growth was driven by Ceramic Shield, our new-to-the-world glass ceramic on the iPhone 12 as well as premium glass sales, IT and tablet glass sales in support of work from home trends, and strength in our advanced optic products. In brief, strong adoption and commercialization of our innovations produced strong year-over-year results for the third quarter for specialty materials, and we expect that to be true for full year 2020 as well. In life sciences, North America lab utilization is increasing, and the pandemic is driving demand for laboratory diagnostic test in consumables.  As a result, we are seeing increased demand for our products. In July, we carried out our long-term plan to ramp a new, larger distribution center needed to support our growth and enhance our ability to address our customers  increased needs around the world. Starting up this center in the middle of a pandemic proved to be more difficult than we expected, which constrained third-quarter sales. Sales declined 8% sequentially.  Net income declined 10%, in line with the lower volume. We have added resources where required implemented recovery plans and are confident that operations will support the required output in Q4. As a result, we expect strong sequential life science growth in the fourth quarter. Now, I ll turn to our balance sheet and our dedication to financial stewardship.  As I mentioned at the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. I ve discussed the operational improvements we ve implemented and our strong free cash flow generation. It is also important to note that we continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong cash position that ended the quarter at $2.5 billion. And we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique.  Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next 15 months, we have under $70 million coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years. And during this time, there is no single year with debt repayment over $500 million.  Our balance sheet is built for times like these. As I ve previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year. We also expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. We have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown.  In closing, we demonstrated outstanding operational performance in the quarter with significant sequential improvement in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow. We are successfully carrying out the operational and financial goals we set up to stay strong during the crisis. We expect another solid quarter to end the year. We remain aware of potential impacts from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest, and geopolitical tensions.  Regardless of how long or what shape the recovery takes, Corning is effectively safeguarding its financial strength, our growth drivers are intact and we continue advancing important growth initiatives with leaders in industries we serve. We are confident that our execution and market leadership positions us to emerge from the current global uncertainty even stronger. With that, let s move to Q&A. Ann?  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Thanks, Tony. OK, Catherine. We re ready for our first question.  Questions & Answers:  Operator  Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open.  Asiya Merchant -- Citi -- Analyst  Great. Thank you, everyone. Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. Wendell, Tony, given the consumer spending has been very strong year-to-date, obviously, we ve seen that in some of the results of our companies.  How do you guys kind of look into the next couple of quarters? Do you feel like visibility is good based on discussions with customers that consumer spending could continue at these levels, you know, as it relates to smartphones, TVs, notebooks, etc., that use up all your products? And then, simultaneously, on the optical side, clearly starting to see some positive trends here. I know it s lumpy, but just as you look at the next couple of quarters, do you feel like you have good visibility at this point into how these quarters unfold. And demand trend continues in the next couple of quarters? Thank you.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Asiya, I think that s an excellent question, and I don t disagree with any of your observations on some of the macro data on both consumer and statements from network operators. That being said, we expect a really solid Quarter 4. And we re just -- and we re off to a really good start this month. But that s really the extent of the guidance that we want to give at this time.  Like last quarter, our business segments, as you just highlighted, continue to flash green. The global uncertainty just reminds us to be very humble in our ability to precisely predict the future and exactly how our customers are going to work their way through this uncertainty. On the opto side, I totally get where you re coming from because we ve all heard from our customers, from the network operators that they re experiencing very strong demand on their network. I mean, there s some great examples.  I mean, they publish this all the time. It s a great website, by the way. The Internet and Television Association reports upstream growth. So, go from your home, up back into the network, that s up 37%.  And also, just recently seen the Microsoft teams set a new single day record of 4.1 billion minutes. Unbelievable, right? And you also hear really strong statements from them that they want to build more capacity to be able to deal with this new baseline of demand that s on. Whether it s AT&T and Verizon or cable TV, companies, or even the public cloud players, they re all quite public that they re planning increases in their capacity. That being said, predicting the exact quarter when these plans turn into deployment at scale, well, that s just challenging.  Just so, once again, I just think we should be very humble in predicting that exact quarter and wait until we see that surge in shipments out of our factories, you know, to claim a rebound in the optical segment.  Asiya Merchant -- Citi -- Analyst  Great. Thank you. And if I may, for Tony, as a follow-up, Tony, given you guys are kind of, you know, managing your capex and inventory levels with very prudently. Should we expect the capex trend that we have been seeing over the last few quarters to sort of continue here? Are we expecting any upsurge in capex at least over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Yes. I think -- I ll say, as we ve talked about before, we have an ongoing amount of capital spending that we expand -- you know, that we spend on kind of expanding our product lines and creating new innovations. But where we really spend a lot of money is when we get into the build cycle, and we re not currently in one of those build cycles, and we don t see ourselves in a build cycle over the next year or so. Of course, we want to eventually get to a build cycle because when we get to a build cycle, that means there s a lot of growth coming, and we always get that with some commitments from customers.  And, you know, we actually saw the benefit of that in the third quarter with our work with Apple. But as we look out over the next several quarters, no, we don t -- we won t be in a build cycle, so we won t see a lot of change from a capex standpoint.  Asiya Merchant -- Citi -- Analyst  Great. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.  Steven Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst  Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the optical question. Maybe this is wrong, but my perception is that there wasn t a lot of content growth in the revenues based on what your customers are spending on right now.  Wendell, can you just sort of talk about the outlook for content growth in optical as you eventually, at whatever point it is, see an optical spending surge? Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  All right. Once again, really good observation, Steve. Most of our operators have been dealing with this year is how do they eliminate some of the bottlenecks in their network, you know, in these challenging times. But while they re being, as you say, you know, quite public on that they re planning to expand their networks.  So, I think the content play is coming, and I believe that it will be quite strong, quite strong, whether it s in cloud because there s been such a huge shift in the cloud during this time, or whether it s in our carriers. Our networks are just trained, and operators don t want to be in a spot where they re running close to red line, and they need to establish that base that is higher. So, I feel really good that it s inevitable, right? But that being said, I call them the quarter, buddy.  Steven Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst  No, I wasn t asking you to. But just to be clear, I know capacity expansion ramp is what would start sort of your content growth coming back. Is that correct? Or am I thinking about it wrong? Thank you.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yes. I think that is correct. That s when you really see it. You re asking actually a super subtle question, which is we have a sort of more Corning play that s going on here as capacity comes in place more optical.  And then we have particular set of innovations that reduce the cost of deployment pretty significantly in the efficacy of it, and those have a higher revenue content for us. So, in that subtle question that you re asking, we ll begin to see that without an acceleration in capacity growth, but you re not really going to feel it. We re not all going to feel great about it until that -- those technologies get deployed in new capacity expansions.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open.  Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I can just have a quick clarification. First, right to your comment when -- about light flashing green, I just want to make sure I m reading it right that you re implying all segments are here in a positive backdrop, where they can improve sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, including Life Sciences, for which you re saying 3Q is that trough.  And then in terms of just drilling down a bit on the specialty outperformance that you re seeing, how much of this is driven by content increase versus wider adoption of the cover glass? And if you can drill down a bit on the different areas on a smartphone, you re gaining content?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Samik, could you -- as a favor to me, could you repeat the second part of that question, I m not sure that I understand it exactly. Could you do that again for me?  Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Yeah. The question was about specialty outperformance that you re seeing in specialty materials? And how much of the outperformance relative to the underlying smartphone market is content increase versus wider adoption of your cover glass? And which are the areas on a smartphone you re gaining content, if you can just outline that?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  OK. So, let me start with your second question first. So, the bulk of that growth that you see is content increase. It s basically of beating players adopting our latest innovations that is driving that revenue increase.  So, that is the primary driver, Samik. To your first question, just to be precise on what I mean by flashing green, I said the same thing last quarter. And what I m trying to get at here is not that we re going to have sequential growth, and not that this one particular business is going to continue to do in a certain thing. What I m trying to get at is sort of the dissonance that we feel between the demand that our customers are putting on us and -- versus sort of the uncertainty we see in around the world.  And so, what I m trying to do is give you the insight that we see, which is our businesses are doing well. We ve got a good order book, and we re operating well. That being said, you know, we still exist in the world that we exist in. We just got to be humble about giving exact guidance.  Does that make sense to you, Samik?  Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Yes. No. Fair. Sound fair given the current environment.  Thank you.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Yeah, thanks for the question. So, I wanted to start off with Ceramic Shield and just -- well, first of all, congratulations on being named on Apple s stage. I think that was the first. So, congrats on that.  I wanted to, Wendell, just ask you whether that s an exclusive deal. And if it is exclusive, did that -- is there a duration on that? Are there other OEMs you could sell it to eventually? Just kind of how are you thinking about exclusivity versus not on some materials like that? And also, maybe -- I doubt you ll tell me, but I d be interested in the pricing differential with Gorilla. And then I have a second question for Tony. I noticed the inventory days jumped up a little bit in Q3.  Tony, could you give us some maybe color on what drove that increase? Is it related to the smartphone cycle or something else? Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Start with...  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, why don t I start with the inventory. One, it s a pretty easy answer. You know, during the quarter, we did the Hemlock transaction, and we had to consolidate their balance sheet, which is increase the inventory for Corning, in total. But, of course, that just comes from that transaction itself.  It s a great transaction. We re really excited about Hemlock. Generates a lot of cash. It pays -- we didn t put any money in.  It pays back the debt, you know, within most of it within a year, we have $150 million of ongoing free cash flow generation. So, you know, what we ll make sure is clear, and we can talk about it in our call later today that how much of the inventory came from that versus our own build. If you look at the cash flow statement, we actually lowered our inventory, about $187 million during the quarter. So, our inventories actually came down during the quarter, but it s because of the Hemlock consolidation that you see a little bit different on the balance sheet.  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  OK. Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  And Rob, to your questions for me. First, your statement. Thank you for the congratulations. We re really proud of that for Ceramic Shield.  It was a lot of work. I have to tell you that it feels, but not quite right to use, Apple s name out loud. I don t think I ve ever done that. Like any size of the company, we have a code name for Apple.  And like, we never even say Apple inside the company. So, like, if you could see me, I sound like turning a little pink, and I m having an anxiety attack that I m using your name out loud. So, if I stumble a little, please be forgiving. So...  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Really soaking it with Apple s name in the [Inaudible].  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  That s exactly right. So Ceramic Shield, that s Apple s. It s that simple. That s Apple s.  They helped us develop it. They invested in U.S. manufacturing for it. That s theirs.  And it should be theirs. And so that s the way that is. Now, as we take a look at other players, we got a whole stream of innovations for them as well. I think what we re -- what we would love to see, ideal scenario would be that Apple has so raised -- I can t believe I just said Apple again, has so raised the bar on performance for everybody that all of the players will be coming to us to say, we need to have a way to compete with this incredible performance.  And, if that happens, that s just going to all be good for us. We will not do Ceramic Shield for them, but we ve got a lot of great ideas and we ve got a lot of great products to help them raise their game to the new level that was just set. I ve got to revert in Cupertino. So, the next one got to how much that you didn t think I would answer was what s the price delta.  I would say, once again, Rod, you have effectively predicted the future. I am not going to answer that.  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  All right. Thanks. Why wasn t it used on the back of the phone? Too expensive?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  You have exhausted my ability to get myself to answer any question about that particular company. I just -- I m reverting back to my mode. And very soon, we re going to go back into using code words. So...  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  OK. All right. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Yes. Thank you. Just to stay on this specialty for a second. On the content increase that you referred to, Wendell, can you talk about whether you meant dollar content, or unit content, or both? And if both, like what the relative split is? And just sort of a little bit technical side of this.  In the -- is the process similar to Gorilla where there s post-processing done by finishers or something different that changes the margin structure of this product? And I have a follow-up on display.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thanks for the question. So, starting with smartphones, I think the right way to think about it is its content in dollars, right? It s just we re introducing more valuable materials, right? Now, quite often with some of them like [Inaudible] is a great example, is it is a more valuable material that we re introducing, but it also reduces finishing cost for our customers. And so as a result, their part cost can be really close to what they had for Gorilla Glass 6. So that s sort of the shape of the way, but you should think about it as it s brand-new products that have a higher price point is the primary way to think about it from your modeling perspective.  That smartphones. I think you ve also got this going on in laptops in the IT piece is we re also bringing up more content. Once again, the right way to think about this is more value added in our product set rather than increasing a mass of glass or ceramics on the products right now. But super interesting question to when you think about 5G, where you ve seen smartphones evolve to, which is this all-glass structure, pretty much, is driven by, yes, we make awesome product, and like glass is the best thing.  I mean, but other than that, is that they need the RF transparency. And if you pop open a 5G phone, any of them, you will see how much antenna content is in there to be able to handle 5G, and an ability to do 4G, and to be able to do different players depending on where you are in the world. This same thing, I believe, is going to come to the IT products, if there are going to be big 5G users, we re going to have to see more mass of our product or volume of our product on those devices to make them be truly great 5G devices. That answer your question, Wamsi?  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Yes. Yes, it does, Wendell. And if I could follow-up, can you talk about the incremental strength in display? There s some concern in the market that there were some ramp issues in the China glass market that s causing one of your competitors to take some share. Can you comment on that? And maybe just talk about any changes in the pace of Korea ramp down? Thank you.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  So, I think from an overall standpoint, what s really driving the strength in display is what s happening in the end markets, and that s what always, you know, matters from a display standpoint. And as – you know, as we talked about, clearly, TV demand in the COVID world has been pretty strong, but so has IT demand. In particular, notebooks and tablets. And, you know, that s fundamentally what we re seeing there.  And you see it in terms of -- in a couple of ways. One is panel maker utilizations have been high. And I think that has slowed down a bit of the exit of -- from Korea by some of the panel makers there. But, in addition to that, the value chain is pretty tight right now.  So, you know, what is really driving this is in customer demand. And even, from a retail standpoint, as we mentioned, as measured in glass, it s up mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis, and that feels good.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Next question?  Operator  Our next question comes from Peter Zdebski with Barclays. Your line is open.  Peter Zdebski -- Barclays -- Analyst  Hi. This is Peter, on for Tim Long. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about GPS.  Prior to the pandemic, I think we were looking at a target of about $350 million of sales in 2020. And given that it looks like the auto rebound has been probably a little stronger than expected. Could you give us an idea of how close you might get to that number for  20? And then maybe your thoughts on timing toward that $500 million target?  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. You know, I think that, you know, fundamentally, what is driving the sales from a GPS standpoint, of course, is the adoption in Europe and the adoption in China. And, you know, on a year-over-year basis, the European market is down. It rebounded a lot in Q3, but it s still down on a year-over-year basis, but China is actually up.  So, I mean, I think we feel good about where GPS sales are. We certainly feel good that we are outperforming the market because of the content-driven part of GPS.  Peter Zdebski -- Barclays -- Analyst  Thank you, Tony.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.  Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Great. A couple of questions. On Valor Glass, you know, understanding, you know, the FDA has had a more -- you know, their fast track policy over the last year on vaccines. But just post any vaccines, just progress you think Valor Glass is making within the FDA do not need a drug by drug approval? And then maybe, second, if there were any kind of administration change to come in the next year, just how quickly could emission standard changes flow through the environmental segment? Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Well, I ll take the first one, and maybe you can take the second. Comment on, if you d like. So, Meta, I think in Valor, we re refueling the broader adoption as well as strategies by our customers to make the regulatory burden be less. I think the way to think about the FDA is they ll react to the plans of our customers, and that will end up providing a basis for how it will evolve in the treatment of Valor Glass.  In general, what I would say is ease of qualification is getting better for us as our customers get more sophisticated in how to do the regulatory moves. You just have to remember, this is the first change, really, in vial packaging in a hundred years. So, everybody was a little out of practice, right? So, we re -- I think with that coming in place, we re getting better. Our real focus though in Valor right now is to support the COVID-19 vaccine efforts.  That s what we re about. And we have focused most of our energy now on supporting various vaccine candidates. And for them, it s a new drug. So, it s -- the new drug is just qualified in our vial because there s no real additional regulatory burden, right? It s the redo that provides an extra burden, not the original.  Our product is superior in every way. From the current product. So that s where we re really focusing our capacity efforts. That s where we re focusing our technology efforts is to use all of Corning s capabilities to make all of us and our children safer, and that s where we re aimed.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  And, Meta, I think in terms of the environmental regulations, you know, the way we look at it isn t as -- at least from our business standpoint and when we will start generating sales, it s not as how quickly the regulations change, it s when the implementations happen. And on environmental regulations, they always take several years to occur. They ve got to change the automotive supply chain and the like. So, while the change in the regulations might be quick in terms of us actually seeing it in sales in North America, that would clearly be a couple of years after that.  Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Great. Thanks.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Next question?  Operator  Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst  Thank you very much. I wanted to add a question. You know, if we look back to April, when you put in place the new operating structure, it was sort of centered around your maps in that. What kind of benefits have you seen from that? How is it working, you know, just given we re, I don t know, five months since it was launched? And then I have a follow-up.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So, we basically -- because our innovations have been successful, we ve sort of outgrown our previous structures. And so, we put in place this new operating structure, with Eric Musser as our President and COO, and named New Market Access platform leaders, next-generation leadership, to take each and every one of our major market access platforms. And it s gone great. And my main evidence for that is look at the results.  I mean, it s really strong. So, I ve got nothing but good things to say about that. And I -- and we are all quite hopeful going forward of this type of outstanding operations performance continues.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst  OK. And then, I don t know, Tony, can you talk a bit about any operational improvements you could make to hemlock now that it s, you know, wholly owned? Just -- or is it where we should just assume it will be stand-alone and there s not much leverage that we had? Thank you.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  I think there is plenty of operational improvements that we can make there. You know, we obviously, based our -- as we thought about why we re excited about this is based on their current operating performance, those long-term take-or-pay contracts that come with upfront cash payments, the good controls that they have over their costs, both in terms of the assets that they bought from DuPont, but also some, you know, long-term energy contracts that are at very favorable rates. And that s why we re confident in that ability to generate the $150 million of annual cash flow. That being said, we will start working on other kind of operational improvements we can make there.  And a good example of that is that we procure a lot more stuff as a company than they do. And so, I m sure there s opportunities there. I think there s opportunities from a technology standpoint, from a general manufacturing standpoint, market access standpoint, you know, chances to, you know, look at different markets than they ve had before. I mean, they will now get the whole power of the Corning machine to really drive that business.  So, you know, I think on the whole, you know, we would expect improvements over time. Now, how quickly that happen and the like all, we re just at the beginning stages of that. And the fact it s going to have the $150 million a year of free cash flow generation is very exciting.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst  Thank you.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Catherine, we ll take one last question.  Operator  Our last question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.  Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst  Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. And my question is about display glass prices.  Is there any opportunity for you to see price improvement even more? I understand that the current structure protects your downside. Just given the tight supply demand right now, is there any way for you to raise price?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I would say that, like you d often heard me say, Martin, about display. It s the right way to think about it from an investment standpoint. In my opinion, I have some of my operating folks who believe we can make this be back into a growth machine. But I continue to believe, we should just count on it as aging gracefully, generating tons of cash flow and pricing being moderate, right? And that we just like normally in a maturing business.  That rate of price decline declining. And I think that s the way to think about it. Yeah, and right now, our primary focus is to make sure we bring up those Gen 10.5 plants that we have put in place. And you can remember, that was when we did this, we did this with largely money support from various Chinese players while we kept 100% of the profit stream.  And that move, when we did it, was really a bet on the growth of large-sized TV and a bet on the Chinese LCD manufacturers. That bet is playing out really well. And the key for us is to grow that into its full capability as fast as we can.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Thanks, Wendell. Great, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we ll be at the Baird Virtual Global Industrial Conference on November 10, the Morgan Stanley Virtual Life After COVID Conference on November 11, the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on November 30, and the Barclays Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference on December 10. Finally, the replay of today s call will be available on our site starting later this morning.  Operator, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.

48,2020-10-27,15:22:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-buys-self-learning-ai-192246478.html,Apple Buys Self-Learning AI Video Company to Improve Apps,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. acquired a startup specializing in advanced artificial intelligence and computer vision technology that may help the iPhone maker improve its own AI across a number of apps and services.
The Cupertino, California-based technology giant acquired Barcelona-based Vilynx Inc. earlier this year, according to people familiar with the deal. Vilynx developed technology that uses AI to analyze a video’s visual, audio and text content to understand what the video shows. It used that technology to create tags for the video, making it searchable.
The deal was completed for about $50 million, said the people who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak about the transaction.
“Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company said in a statement.
Vilynx applied its technology to software that companies used for search and recommendation engines for video and other media. On its now defunct website, the startup touted the ability of its system to not only recognize items, but understand them.
“Recognition is detecting Michael Jordan’s face,” the website said. “Understanding is knowing it’s Michael Jordan, the former NBA basketball player who played for the Chicago Bulls and went to the University of North Carolina.”
Apple could potentially apply this technology to the company’s digital assistant, Siri, and its search. It could also be used in the company’s Photos app to make video more searchable in a similar fashion to how users can find photos by searching for items inside the photos. Apple could also potentially apply it toward a recommendation engine for its TV and News apps to surface more relevant content to users.
About 50 of the company’s engineers and data scientists are remaining at Apple, including Vilynx’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Elisenda Bou-Balust, the people familiar said.
Apple is keeping Vilynx’s Barcelona office and intends to make it one of the company’s main artificial intelligence research and development centers in Europe, the people said. Apple has started hiring engineers for the office. Apple also has AI engineers in Europe in Cambridge, U.K.; Cork, Ireland; Munich and Zurich.
The deal adds to a growing list of AI companies purchased by Apple in recent years. In 2020, Apple also acquired Xnor.ai, Inductiv and Voysis to bolster its artificial intelligence efforts.
Apple launched Siri in 2011 and has since expanded AI across its software, including the Camera and Photos apps, battery life optimization, and facial and handwriting recognition. But while the company has made strides to improve the machine learning technology, the Siri voice assistant is still regarded as inferior to rivals from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc.
Apple’s recent AI-related deals, an increased public presence for the machine learning group, the hiring of new researchers and the appointment of former Google executive John Giannandrea signal the company’s effort to make major improvements.

""We are serious,"" Sievert told Yahoo Finance about his fresh effort to challenge pay TV providers. To be sure, the mobile phone operator (at least until now) made a big splash Tuesday by entering the surging streaming content space.
On Nov. 1, T-Mobile will launch nationwide what it calls TVision LIVE. It will feature three different pay and content tiers. The entry level one is called TVision Live TV. It will cost $40 a month for 30-plus channels including ABC, Fox, NBC, Turner and ESPN. Go up to the top tier called TVision Live Zone, you get more than 50 channels (NFL Network, SEC Network, etc.) and NFL Red Zone for $60.
Rounding out the attack plan is the TVision VIBE service (offers live and on-demand programming for $10 a month) and TVision CHANNELS service (a-la-carte streaming offering).
The pricing is well below typical cable TV plans from the likes of Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) that could fetch north of $150 a month. Those sky high cable bills — and the fact people don t watch a majority of the channels they pay for — is what continues to fuel cord-cutting across the U.S.
Well that and because original programming out of Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) is so darn compelling and a monthly subscription is still dirt cheap.
To lure in customers, T-Mobile has joined forces with Apple to offer one free year of Apple TV+. That s provided a person signs up for the premium TVision bundles. Sievert says T-Mobile has no intention of creating its own content a la Netflix or Amazon.
The T-Mobile-Apple partnership is not unlike the one Yahoo Finance s parent Verizon (VZ) and Disney (DIS) have worked on. Verizon has continued to offer Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ to mobile phone subscribers this year who trade up to larger data plans. Last October, Verizon struck first on streaming by offering one free year of Disney+ to 4G LTE and 5G unlimited wireless customers and FiOS internet households.

50,2020-10-27,13:28:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gary-cohn-would-back-bidens-proposed-28-corporate-tax-rate-172828437.html,Ex-Trump adviser Gary Cohn would back Bidens proposed 28% corporate tax rate,"President Donald Trump’s former chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, once helped craft the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that lowered the corporate federal income tax rate (TCJA) from 35% to 21%. Yet he’s comfortable with the rate moving no higher than 28%, a level proposed by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Cohn told Yahoo Finance’s Adam Shapiro in an interview during Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit on Monday.
The 28% corporate tax rate proposed by Biden would still make the U.S. an attractive place for businesses, according to Cohn, a Democrat who served for a decade as COO for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. before his time in the White House.
“How do you compete against every other nation in the world? Because international corporations can decide where they’re domiciled ... To me, 28% is probably a good number to land on, to end up being attractive to corporations to be in the United States,” Cohn said.
And it’s not just the tax rate, Cohn added, it s what is being taxed. Under the CARES Act, he said, in order to stimulate the economy, corporate deductions eliminated under Trump’s tax law, such as travel and entertainment, were brought back.
The Trump administration’s tax overhaul has come under criticism given persistent loopholes that allow corporations to drive the effective rate well below the statutory level. In 2018, the work arounds helped a group of 378 consistently profitable Fortune 500 companies to pay an average federal rate of 11.3% on their 2018 income, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-partisan think tank.
But Cohn said the overhaul still got rid of many loopholes.
“Let s compare it to what it was prior,” Cohn said of Trump’s tax law. “There were many corporations paying no tax under the prior tax law, as well. We eliminated a lot of the loopholes. I m not going to sit here and say we eliminate all the loopholes. We eliminated many, many of the loopholes.”
The ITEP’s most recent report on corporate tax loopholes may tell a different story. It analyzed the rates paid by profitable Fortune 500 companies during one year under the new rate and eight years under the prior rate. Both resulted in effective rates paid of just more than half the statutory rates.
From 2008 to 2015 when the tax rate was 35%, 258 consistently profitable Fortune 500 corporations paid an effective corporate tax rate of 21.2%, with many prominent companies like General Electric (GE), Priceline.com, and PG&E (PCG) paying no tax at all, according to the ITEP analysis.
In 2018, among 379 profitable corporations in the study the effective federal rate paid was 11.3%, with 91 corporations including Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX), Halliburton (HAL) and IBM (IBM) paying zero federal income tax.
ITEP concluded that loopholes and special breaks rather than the rate itself were responsible for the shortfalls.
“We still have a huge offshoring issue,” Cohn said of loopholes still needing to be closed. “You can create these intellectual property boxes offshore and put your intellectual property in them and then license them back to your U.S. subsidiary. We were doing a lot of work on that. We went as far as we thought we could go and get a tax bill passed.”
Practices known as the “Double Irish” and “Dutch Sandwich” were popularized by Apple (AAPL) and adopted by companies with large intangible assets, predominantly intellectual property, to avoid paying income tax. Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others have used the strategy to push profits to tax havens in Bermuda, for example, through wholly owned subsidiaries in Ireland and The Netherlands. In 2019, Google announced it would no longer implement the tax strategy and going forward would license its IP in the U.S. instead of in Bermuda.
Asked whether a 28% rate was counter to the federal government’s goal of clawing back tax dollars to federal coffers, Cohn said the figure represents one that is the upper limit of what corporations will view as competitive.
“There s a rate where it gets too high, where they don t want to be,” Cohn said. “That 21% to me was the lower end of where we needed to be.”

51,2020-10-27,12:45:00,AAPL,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/27/better-buy-lumentum-vs-texas-instruments/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,Better Buy: Lumentum vs. Texas Instruments,"Lumentum  and Texas Instruments  are both major supply chain players in the tech sector. Lumentum produces optical chips and lasers, and TI sells chips to automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and communication infrastructure companies.  Both companies have suffered disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis, but their stocks stayed resilient: Over the past 12 months, Lumentum s stock has risen nearly 50% as TI s stock advanced more than 20%. Let s see why Lumentum stayed ahead of TI, and whether or not that trend will continue.  How fast is Lumentum growing?  Lumentum generated 90% of its revenue from its optical communications unit -- which sells optical chips to service providers and data center customers, as well as 3D-sensing chips for advanced cameras -- in fiscal 2020, which ended on June 27. The remaining 10% came from its laser unit, which sells lasers for manufacturing, inspection, and life science purposes.  The optical communication unit s top customer is Apple , which installs Lumentum s optical chips in the iPhone s 3D-sensing cameras. Orders from Apple accounted for 26% of Lumentum s total revenue last year, and that percentage could rise this year with the addition of a LiDAR sensor in the iPhone 12 Pro.  But another major customer is Huawei, which still accounted for 13% of Lumentum s sales last year despite being blacklisted by U.S. regulators. It expects its sales to Huawei to continue declining in fiscal 2021.  Lumentum s total revenue grew 7% to $1.68 billion last year, marking its slowest growth in four years, as a 16% decline in its laser revenue partly offset its 11% growth in optical communications revenue.  The pandemic hurt the laser business, which had already been struggling with weaker demand for fiber lasers, more than the optical business, which offset its slower enterprise optical chip sales with higher 3D-sensing chip sales.  Despite those challenges, Lumentum s adjusted gross and operating margins still expanded in fiscal 2020, thanks to a better product mix and tighter cost controls, and its adjusted earnings grew 28%. Lumentum hasn t offered a full-year forecast for fiscal 2021, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 5% and 4%, respectively, before accelerating to double-digit levels in 2022.  How fast is Texas Instruments growing?  Texas Instruments generated 75% of its revenue from analog chips, which include power and signal chain chips, in the first nine months of 2020. Its embedded processing chips, which include connected microcontrollers and processors, generated another 18%.  The remaining 7% came from other types of chips. None of TI s customers accounted for over 10% of its revenue last year.  TI generated 57% of its revenue from the industrial and automotive markets last year, up from 42% in 2013. It believes those two markets will generate long-term tailwinds as factories rely more on automation and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cars add more chips to their infotainment and driverless systems.  Unfortunately, the pandemic disrupted many industrial companies and shut down major automakers. The company couldn t fully offset that slowdown with stronger sales of chips for personal electronics and healthcare customers, and its total revenue dipped 6% year-over-year to $10.39 billion in the first nine months of the year.  But on the bright side, TI s constant buybacks boosted its EPS 1% even as its gross and operating margins contracted. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 7% and 1%, respectively, before rebounding with single-digit growth rates next year.  TI s near-term prospects seem dimmer than Lumentum s, but investors should keep two things in mind. First, TI s ongoing shift from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which cuts production costs by about 40%, should buoy its gross margins after the pandemic passes.  Second, the company remains committed to returning most of its free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. It s raised its dividend annually for 17 straight years, currently pays a forward yield of 2.7%, and reduced its share count by nearly 50% over the past 16 years. Lumentum doesn t pay a dividend, and it rarely repurchases any shares.  The valuations and verdict  Lumentum trades at just 15 times forward earnings, but TI has a much higher forward P/E ratio of 26. Investors are likely paying a premium for TI because they consider it a good defensive play for a volatile market, but it s a bit pricey relative to its near-term growth.  Lumentum isn t as well-diversified as TI, but it s sitting on multiple catalysts -- including the expansion of the 5G market, the use of LiDARs in driverless cars, and the iPhone 12 -- and trading at a low valuation. Therefore, I firmly believe Lumentum will continue to outperform TI over the next few quarters."

For the quarter, the company posted “core” sales of $3 billion, up 1% from a year ago and 16% sequentially, and a bit above the Street consensus at $2.93 billion. Non-GAAP earnings were 43 cents a share, ahead of the Wall Street analyst consensus at 36 cents.  “Sales and operating income grew on improving demand and commercialization of our innovations,” Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said in a statement. “In all the industries we serve, important market trends are offering new opportunities that we’re uniquely qualified to address.”  Weeks added that while Corning’s markets “continue to flash green,” the company is “keeping a tight focus on cost and manufacturing execution.”  The strongest sector in the quarter was Specialty Materials, where sales were up 23%, driven in part by Apple’s adoption of the company’s new “ceramic shield” display material included in the new iPhone 12, and highlighted in Apple’s recent launch event. The company also noted that Samsung is using the latest version of the company’s Gorilla Glass displays in the Galaxy Note20 Ultra smartphone.  Sales were up 4% year-over-year in display technologies, which mostly supplies television manufacturers. The company said that price declines “were moderate” in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down 10% in optical communications, off 5% in environmental technologies, and down 13% in life sciences.  Corning didn’t provide fourth-quarter financial guidance.  Corning shares were down 1.9% to $33.60 in recent trading.  Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com"
54,2020-10-27,12:02:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/backed-mr-beast-nadeshot-backbone-160202057.html,"Backed by Mr. Beast and Nadeshot, Backbone One could finally crack mobile gaming","I get to play with a lot of new hardware from startups and it runs the gamut from super polished to barely working, neither of which is a value judgement! But every once in a while I get to mess with a new piece of kit that is just so fully realized that I am literally shocked. 
The Backbone One controller is one of those situations. It’s a game controller for iPhones that has slick ergonomics, solid button feel, sensitive analog triggers and great build quality. But what makes Backbone One special is the companion app and service that ships with it and enables a truly clever software layer enabling cross-app multiplayer, game recording, highlight editing and quick swap. 
Designers from Ideo and Astro Studios helped realize Backbone and the pedigree of people who have crafted devices like the Xbox 360 controller really show here. Wide L1/R1 buttons make it easy to tap on mobile. Analog L2/R2 triggers feel deep but tight. The latest Lightning connector standard means extremely low latency for control signals. 
The controller is around 7” long in its compact state and uses a clever sliding mechanism to expand outwards to up to 10” in size. It easily fits Apple’s “Plus” sized phones and when you’re using one of those it feels like a full on game console for the first time I can remember.
There are acoustic tunneling scoops at the inside edges that direct sound forward from the phone speakers and there is work being done behind the scenes to cancel out the specific sounds the Backbone One’s buttons make so that you don’t hear those while you’re playing. 
But it’s the software that makes Backbone One really special.
To co-opt a biblical phrase, hardware without software is dead. And the Backbone One is really, really alive.
Behind the Backbone One is Backbone itself, which is a ‘companion app’ but is really a live gaming service. It has integrated cross-game voice chat, game switching, parties and a friends list. It lets you get push notifications when your friends are on and slide right into a game with them with a single tap. It’s remarkably slick and feels as first-party as you could make something that is literally not first-party feel.
Backbone was founded by Maneet Khaira in the summer of 2018 while interning at YouTube and wrapping up at Columbia. 
Khaira notes that one of the biggest issues in mobile gaming is that there is a ton of activation energy when it comes to jumping in and playing with friends. The major games are there: Call of Duty, Fortnite (eventually, again), PUBG -- but the last mile issue is major. 
Khaira points out that while there are plenty of examples of top-tier gaming titles on iPhone, there is just a desert of content created on these platforms available to watch on Twitch or YouTube. He likens it to a hysteresis -- a lagging behind of an effect from its cause. There are so many mobile gamers that there should be a ton of mobile content shared, but because the mechanisms to do so have been so poor and so under-crafted, we have next to nothing. 
Backbone changes that completely. 
Here are the basic pillars of Backbone:
Gameplay has to feel good. The Backbone controller had to be best-in-class hardware.
Content creation. It had to be easy and seamless to capture highlights, clips and footage and share them to your preferred platform. 
Playing with friends has to be instantaneous. Backbone uses notifications about when friends start playing across any game and you can do so from one central friends list. 
Because Backbone is a support app, it gets a bunch of special privileges that would normally not be granted to a ‘regular’ class of app. Backbone One is always on while it’s attached, which means that the app can do whatever it needs to do no matter what app you’re in or for how long. This is huge because it enables the Backbone button on the controller to add games to your dashboard, swap easily between them and lets you get at your friends list contained in Backbone.
The stopwatch time for attaching the Backbone One to your phone and beginning to play a game in multiplayer is measured in seconds, not minutes. It’s exactly what you need in the mobile context.
[gallery ids=""2066280,2066277,2066262,2066265,2066258,2066259""]
It also enables any-time recording of clips and highlights that store locally on your device but can be uploaded anywhere at 1080p/30fps HEVC. When you’re in game you can just smash the Capture button to start recording and tap it to screenshot. The Backbone app also has some ML work going on to identify highlight-worthy clips and mark them automatically. You can also tag them yourself while you play.
And Backbone One does this on less power than the crap earbuds that (used to) come in an iPhone box. You won’t notice any major power drain from the accessory itself. 
If Backbone can manage to get a partnership with one or two majors to have a built-in control scheme that takes advantage of the proper dead zones and timing it could be a real watershed moment for mobile gaming. 
But right now it works with most games that have controller support right out of the box. No game needs to do anything special to take advantage of the majority of Backbone features. This basically adds on a layer of inter-game social and clip sharing. 
It’s all of the basic features of Game Center, Twitch, PSN and Xbox Live rolled into one -- but on iPhone. And, of course, the BackBone one works just fine with Xbox and PlayStation remote play apps.
Sometimes a list of investors can tell you a lot about how serious a company is about getting the right kind of money. For a company building a gaming service and peripheral hardware, Backbone couldn’t have a more solid column. Backbone is backed by MrBeast, Preston, Kwebbelkop, Typical Gamer, Night Media, Nadeshot, and Ludlow Ventures, as well as Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures. Pretty much exactly the profile I would want to see for a company serious about social and mobile gaming. 
In many ways, Backbone feels like a spiritual successor to OpenFeint. If you’re not familiar, OpenFeint was the first modern mobile gaming network. It launched the year after the iPhone App Store and was part of a game called Aurora Feint. It enabled multiplayer, scoreboards and messaging. The founder of OpenFeint? Jason Citron. Jason’s current startup, that also shares a lot of spiritual luggage with OpenFeint? Discord.
It’s hard to overstate how important OpenFeint was at the time. As the app ecosystem was emerging it was clear that games would be a big part of what made the iPhone successful and this was the first cross-game network that allowed people to take advantage of one of the first phones to have a persistent, high-quality (ish) internet connection. Apple launched Game Center as a basic response to this need but it has never put any real investment behind it since. Backbone is so good that I could actually see Apple hauling out the repo and assigning engineering talent to get it working well again. The time has come for this idea and Backbone’s execution is so top notch here that it makes the case open and shut.
I’ve been testing the controller for a few weeks now with a variety of games. I played a quick match of Call of Duty Warzone with Khaira and even though we didn’t secure the dub it was massively more playable than running with touch controls. My very first session of CoD I had a 28 kill game in cod mobile and, even though I was put into a lobby that prioritizes controller users the other players had like 5 kills each. Though you can now pair console controllers to iPhone, the Backbone is so much better than any of the other integrated controllers on the market that it will quickly become a must have for any mobile player that actually wants to be competitive. I have spent as much time with Apple mobile hardware and the people that have created it as probably anyone on the planet so please understand that I don’t say this lightly but this really feels like the game controller and network Apple would have made if it understood competitive games."

This is especially thanks to the global digital shift that has accelerated e-commerce for everything ranging from remote working to entertainment and shopping. Now, all eyes are currently on FAANGs ahead of its quarterly results.Streaming giant Netflix NFLX, the first company in the FAANG group to report Q3 earnings, came up with disappointing results on Oct 20. The company registered its weakest subscriber gains in four years and missed the earnings estimate (read: Netflix Disappoints: ETFs in Focus).FacebookFacebook is expected to release its earnings report on Oct 29 after market close. Our proven model predicts reasonable chances of beating estimates for Facebook this time around as it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +1.82%. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The social media giant has seen positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be reported quarter indicates an earnings decline of 9% from the year-ago reported figure. Revenues are expected to increase 12.2%. Facebook delivered earnings surprise of 9.11%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock has a VGM Score of B but belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 19%).

In fact, that ill-fated wager owns the crown of “worst short call” of the past five years, beating out other notable short-slayers like Apple AAPL, -4.63% and Amazon AMZN, -3.76% .  Of course, not all shorts have been caught on the wrong side of the technology leaders of this bull run. Plenty have managed to cash in on the struggles of some of the market’s biggest names in 2020.  Topping the list of winners for those who bet on falling stocks, according to S3 Partners data cited by the ValueWalk blog, is oil giant ExxonMobil XOM, -3.80% , which has delivered mark-to-market profits of $1.7 billion so far this year for short sellers. Rising crude inventories and dropping oil prices have been a gift to short-sellers, as the stock has lost more than half its value so far this year. It didn’t help that ExxonMobil lost its status as a Dow component.  Next up, AT&T T, -1.56% , the telecom company which has been bogged down with a hefty debt load, job cuts, asset sales and disappointing numbers for its pay TV platforms. Music to the shorts’ ears, as they’ve enjoyed mark-to-market profits of more than $1.5 billion.  Rounding out the list of the top five best shorts in 2020 are Wells Fargo WFC, -2.93% and Simon Property Group SPG, -1.96% , both delivering more than $1.3 billion in profits for shorts, and Raytheon RTX, -7.41% , which has resulted in a $1.2-billion win."

(Reuters) - Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook, together accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500 s total value, report their quarterly results on Thursday, with their stocks trading near record highs, even as they face increasing antitrust scrutiny.
Amazon and Apple have surged 74% and 57%, respectively, this year, far outperforming the S&P 500 s 5% gain as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates trends toward online shopping, video streaming and other technologies helping Wall Street s largest companies take market share from smaller rivals.
Big Tech for years has been criticized for choking competition and stifling smaller competitors, and investors are looking for signs that they are extending their lead during the pandemic. However, antitrust storm clouds in recent months have increased.
A scathing report by a House of Representatives panel this month detailing abuses of market power by large tech companies suggests a tough road ahead should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in polls, win the Nov. 3 election.
""There seems to be a lot of angst and desire to not only fine these companies, but potentially change the way they do their business. In the past, there was a lot of lip service, but now you are starting to see some pretty active postures,"" said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.
Morgan said he expects to see companies set money aside to pay for potential future fines.
Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have a combined stock market value of $5.5 trillion, compared to the S&P 500 s $29 trillion market capitalization.
Their reports come amid turbulence on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 on Monday posting its biggest daily decline in four weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and uncertainty about a fiscal relief bill in Washington dim the outlook for an economic recovery.
Microsoft, which posts its results late on Tuesday, has elevated its stock market value by a third in 2020 to $1.6 trillion. Investors expect the software maker to report an 8% rise in quarterly revenue and a 10% jump in net income, with Cowen analyst Derrick Wood saying in a recent client note that Windows sales could get a lift from additional laptop demand as people keep working from home.
S&P 500 technology sector earnings per share are seen rising 0.3% in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
By comparison, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to see an aggregate decline of 16.7% in their third-quarter earnings as the U.S. economy remains crippled by the pandemic.
Amazon s September-quarter report will likely be a ""calm before the storm"" as the online retailer builds more fulfillment centers in anticipation of a busy holiday shopping season, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a client note on Monday.
""With a holiday crunch expected, the scale and pace at which (Amazon) is bringing incremental capacity online is encouraging,"" Shmulik wrote.
Twitter also reports its results on Thursday, with analysts on average expecting a 9% revenue decline as advertisers hurt by the pandemic spend less.
Analysts on average expect Apple s report after the bell on Thursday to reflect a 0.5% drop in revenue to $63.7 billion and net income down 11.2% to $12.1 billion. However, Apple investors are mostly focused on the outlook for sales of the newest iPhone and growth in recurring revenue from apps, games and video and music streaming."

Leveraging a familiar strategy of adding state-of-the-art specs in a repurposed old chassis while charging a mid-range price, sales expectations for the iPhone SE 2 were high as the public health crisis has impacted discretionary incomes. Counterpoint Research initially estimated that Apple would sell 15 million iPhone SE 2 units this year.  New data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) reinforces that optimism.  The midrange iPhone was a hit  The iPhone SE 2 represented approximately 22% of the iPhone mix in the U.S. during the third quarter, according to CIRP. The iPhone 11 lineup accounted for another 64% of sales, which was before the Cupertino tech giant unveiled the iPhone 12 after the end of the quarter. Like many retailers, Apple s retail operations had to quickly adapt to lockdown orders and safety guidelines imposed by governments around the world.  ""In its first full quarter of sales, the $399 iPhone SE accounted for almost one-quarter of iPhone sales,"" CIRP partner and co-founder Josh Lowitz said in a release. ""During a challenging quarter, with COVID-19 altering the retail landscape and delaying launch of new 2020 flagship models, the new SE model succeeded in attracting customers with old phones in need of an upgrade.""  Apple s represented a greater share of total U.S. retail distribution than other channels like big-box electronics stores or wireless carriers. An estimated 21% of iPhone sales were conducted directly through Apple (including both retail stores and online), up from 13% a year ago. Overall, carriers remain the dominant distribution channel for people to buy new smartphones, accounting for 71% of domestic iPhone sales last quarter.  CIRP s estimates were derived from a survey of 500 Apple customers in the U.S. in the third quarter.  Driving Android switchers  The iPhone SE 2 has clearly resonated with consumers, particularly when acknowledging the macroeconomic impacts of the virus outbreak, which were partially mitigated by government stimulus efforts. CEO Tim Cook noted on the last earnings call that the device was appealing to people that prefer smaller phones, while Apple is seeing a higher number of users switch from Android to the iPhone SE 2.  ""We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages,"" CFO Luca Maestri added. Cook said that the mid-range iPhone s momentum was continuing into the third quarter.  The mix will inevitably shift aggressively toward the iPhone 12 lineup in the fourth quarter. Apple reports quarterly results on Thursday."
61,2020-10-27,09:59:00,AAPL,https://www.investopedia.com/what-apple-stands-to-lose-from-lawsuit-against-google-5084423?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,What Apple Stands to Lose From Lawsuit Against Google,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a milestone antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. s (GOOG) Google last week, which could implicate and negatively affect another Silicon Valley giant: Apple Inc. (AAPL). Recent analysis estimates suggest that the lawsuit could in fact prove more damaging for Apple in the immediate term if the agreement between the two companies is jeopardized.  ""There is a risk, if you play it out, that there actually could be more financial impact to Apple than there is for Google,"" Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Bernstein, told The Wall Street Journal in an article published on Oct. 26, estimating that Apple stock could decline as much as 20% if the agreement with Google is dissolved.  The landmark lawsuit, which follows a 16-month investigation by the House of Representatives  judiciary committee, is a part of a broader regulatory push against big tech. However, it remains unclear which of the Silicon Valley companies will prove more vulnerable to mounting regulatory pressure.  The lawsuit highlighted the pact between Apple and Google, an increasing collaboration between the two companies to have Google s search engine as the default choice on Apple products, including the iPhone.  Broadly, the lawsuit accuses Google of abusing monopoly power and ""unlawfully maintaining monopolies through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices"" in search and advertising segments. It specifically mentions Apple in ""long-term agreements with Apple that require Google to be the default – and de facto exclusive – general search engine on Apple s popular Safari browser and other Apple search tools.""  The lawsuit describes that the relationship s evolution from Google being the default search engine on Apple s Safari browser in 2005 in exchange for ad revenue to a broader agreement that included iPhones and later Apple s assistant Siri. ""Today, Google s distribution agreement with Apple gives Google the coveted, preset default position on all significant search access points for Apple computers and mobile devices,"" the Justice Department stated.  The filing cites Google estimates that 50% of its search traffic comes from Apple devices. For Apple, it s clear that the impact would be significant. Google s payments to Apple are projected at $8 billion to $12 billion per year, which make up about 15% to 20% of Apple s global net income.  Google s argument essentially boils down to ""everyone is doing it"" and the idea that it s easy to change your browser setting if you want to. ""Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software,"" said Kent Walker, Google s senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post titled ""A deeply flawed lawsuit that would do nothing to help consumers."" According to Walker s post, ""Apple s iPhone makes it simple to change your settings and use alternative search engines in Safari – and it s even easier in iOS14 where you can add widgets from different providers or swipe on the home screen to search.""  The investigation from the House antitrust panel earlier this month found that the issue was more with the mobile operating system and broader ecosystem that the consumers became locked into. ""There are significant barriers to switching between the dominant mobile operating systems,"" they found.  There are many uncertainties about how this lawsuit will play out, the outcome of the presidential election, the race for the senate, and the overall regulatory and political climate to hold big tech accountable. For Apple investors, there are also many questions about the sales of the iPhone 12 series, the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries, and retail sales there. Any scaled-down version of Apple s strategic relationship with Google or the potential loss of Google revenue would definitely have a negative impact both in the immediate and longer term.  Whatever the outcome of the lawsuit, it s clear that this is just the beginning. Over the months and years to come, there will be more political and public scrutiny of existing big tech firms, how they do business together, and the impact of these practices on consumers."

Just brace for some surprises as mega-tech firms report their quarterly results.  X  Giant S&P 500 technology and related stocks, like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), are seeing volatility in October. Investors will use what they learn this week from earnings reports to pin their convictions and price targets on tech stocks all year.  Already, S&P 500 tech stock investors are showing their nervousness. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is down 0.7% in October. That s highly unusual. It means the technology sector is the second worst of the 11 S&P 500 sectors this month. Only the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) is down more in October, at 2.2%. And tech stocks are lagging the S&P 500 s 1.1% gain in the month.  That s a reversal from tech stocks  leadership all year. Tech stocks are up 26.4% this year, easily topping the S&P 500 s 5.5% 2020 gain.  ""Stocks and tech names remain weak as second wave fears and jitters heading into the U.S. elections are creating a bit of a risk-off trade heading into a big week for tech earnings,"" said Dan Ives, tech stock analyst at Wedbush Securities.  Here are some surprises worth looking for in tech stocks:  Microsoft Will Grow Faster Than Apple  Apple is the most valuable S&P 500 company at $1.97 trillion. But analysts think Microsoft will outgrow its tech rival in the third quarter.  Analysts think Microsoft will earn $1.55 a share on revenue of $35.8 billion in the third quarter. If analysts are right, that s 12% quarterly earnings growth on 8.2% revenue growth from the same year-ago period. In fact, over the past month analysts have increased their profit forecasts for Microsoft. Microsoft is expected to report on Oct. 27. Here s what to know if you re thinking about buying Microsoft stock.  That quarterly growth leaves Apple is in the dust. The iPhone maker is seen posting 7.8% lower profit of 70 cents a share on 1.2% less revenue of $63.3 billion. Analysts actually trimmed their Apple earnings target the past month by 0.4%. Apple is expected to report on Oct. 29.  Amazon Will Further Surpass Microsoft In S&P 500 Value  Microsoft is worth $1.6 trillion now, making it the third-most valuable S&P 500 stock after Apple and Amazon. But it will likely get further surpassed by Amazon.com in the next 12 months, analysts say.  Analysts think Amazon has a monster quarter coming up. The online retailer, technically in the consumer discretionary sector, is expected to earn 70% more in the quarter, to $7.20 a share, on 32% higher revenue of $92.5 billion.  And that s a big reason why analysts think the company will be worth $1.88 trillion in 12 months. That s more than 15% above what Amazon is worth now. It s also more than the $1.79 trillion, or 12% more, analysts think Microsoft will be worth in 12 months.  Facebook Is More Resilient Than Many Thought  Social media giant Facebook was supposed to get ravaged by advertiser boycotts and election scrutiny. But investors might be surprised how none of these factors hurt the company much.  Shares of Facebook, technically in the S&P 500 communications services sector, are already holding up better than many of its big tech rivals in October. Facebook stock is up 9.2% in October. That tops the 2.5% gain in Microsoft, 8.3% gain by Apple, 6.5% increase in Alphabet and 1.4% rise in Amazon shares in October.  Even with hundreds of advertisers pulling back on Facebook, analysts think the company s revenue will jump 12% in the third quarter to $19.8 billion. And yes, profit is seen falling 10% in the quarter to $1.91 a share. But Facebook is seen making $23.1 billion in 2020, which is only down roughly 6% from 2019. And profit is expected to jump more than 20% in 2021. Facebook is expected to report on Oct. 29.  ""Facebook s advertising business is proving more resilient than most other digital platforms throughout Covid-19 recession, and with regulatory risks potentially waning a bit, there appears more room for multiple expansion,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.

63,2020-10-27,08:00:00,AAPL,https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220,Is Apple Stock A Buy Right Now? Here's What Its Stock Chart Shows,"Apple (AAPL) saw its shares jump into record high territory after its June-quarter earnings report. The consumer electronics giant surged to a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. But with a pullback in Apple stock, many investors are wondering if AAPL stock is a buy right now.  X  Apple has been an American success story several times over. First, it ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II. Then it reinvented the PC in the 1980s with the Macintosh.  Co-founder Steve Jobs returned to run Apple in 1997 and oversaw a winning streak of innovations that included the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad and the App Store.  The biggest driver of Apple s modern success is the iPhone. The game-changing smartphone, which debuted in 2007, sparked years of massive growth and created a loyal base of customers willing to buy Apple products and services.  But iPhone sales have slowed as users hold on to their handsets for longer periods between upgrades. However, the company could be on the brink of a major upgrade cycle with its first 5G iPhones.  Apple Stock News: iPhone 12 Debuts  On Oct. 23, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company began selling the 5G-enabled iPhone 12 series. The handsets have display sizes of 5.4, 6.1 and 6.7 inches and starting prices ranging from $699 to $1,099.  In addition to ultrafast 5G wireless connectivity, the 14th-generation iPhones have improved cameras, speedier processors and a new design. The Pro models of the iPhone 12 have a new rear-facing lidar scanner. Lidar, short for ""light detection and ranging,"" will permit depth sensing for photo and video applications, including faster autofocus in lowlight situations. Plus, it will open up new possibilities for augmented-reality experiences.  Apple introduced the iPhone 12 along with the HomePod Mini smart speaker at an online event on Oct. 13. However, investors were unimpressed. Apple stock fell 2.7% the day of the iPhone 12 debut. It was Wall Street s worst reception ever to an iPhone launch.  The next potential catalyst for Apple stock will be the company s September-quarter earnings report, due Oct. 29.  Wall Street expects Apple to earn 71 cents a share on sales of $64.16 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. In the year-earlier period, Apple earned 76 cents a share on sales of $64.04 billion. That would translate to a year-over-year decline of 7% in earnings on flat sales.  Apple Opportunities For Growth  With iPhone growth slowing, investors are wondering what the next big growth driver will be for Apple stock.  Lately, two businesses have given Apple s sales and profits a boost: services and wearables.  In the June quarter, Apple s services revenue rose 15% to $13.16 billion. Services include App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.  Meanwhile, Apple s Wearables, Home and Accessories unit saw sales jump 17% to $6.45 billion in the June quarter. This unit includes wearables like the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless earbuds and Beats headphones. It also contains the Apple HomePod wireless speaker and other miscellaneous gadgets.  At a product launch event on Sept. 15, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 6 smartwatches and the lower-cost Apple Watch SE. It also introduced subscription service bundles called Apple One as well as the new Apple Fitness+ service. Still, Apple stock sold off on the news.  Apple Earnings: Beat And No Guidance  On July 30, Apple delivered better-than-expected June-quarter results.  Apple earned $2.58 a share on sales of $59.7 billion in its fiscal third quarter ended June 27. Analysts had predicted earnings of $2.04 a share on sales of $52.25 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Apple earnings rose 18% while sales climbed 11%.  In the June quarter, iPhone sales climbed 2% to $26.42 billion. The company s new lower-cost iPhone SE gave sales a lift in the quarter.  Mac computer sales jumped 22% to $7.08 billion in the June quarter. IPad sales leapt 31% to $6.58 billion. The work-from-home and school-at-home trends driven by the Covid-19 pandemic fueled the gains in both product categories.  Apple did not issue guidance for the September quarter, citing market uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts say Apple might not give December-quarter guidance because of the later-than-usual launch of the new iPhones.  Exclusive Apple Stock Ratings  Since the bounce back from the lows of the coronavirus stock market crash, Apple stock has been outperforming the broader market.  AAPL stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 91 out of 99. That puts it in the top 9% of stocks over the past 12 months.  Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of 99, according to the IBD Stock Checkup tool. IBD s Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical performance into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.  In August 2018, Apple became the first company to reach a market value of over $1 trillion. Since it hit that milestone, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have joined it in the trillion-dollar club.  Apple stock was the first to gain a market value of over $1.5 trillion in early June. Amazon and Microsoft have since followed.  On Aug. 19, AAPL stock became the first to reach a market cap of $2 trillion. Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said Apple stock could reach a $3 trillion market cap sometime this decade.  AAPL Stock Technical Analysis  On April 29, Apple stock broke out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base at a split-adjusted buy point of 72.16, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.  The Dow Jones tech giant later passed a secondary buy point of 80.02 from a cup-with-handle base visible on a weekly MarketSmith chart. IBD Leaderboard analysis provided several additional buy points during its ascent.  On Sept. 2, Apple stock notched a record high of 137.98 on a split-adjusted basis in intraday trading. However, it ended the day down 2.1% amid a sell-off in technology stocks. AAPL stock closed the regular session on Oct. 23 at 115.04.  Is Apple Stock A Buy Right Now?  Apple stock is not a buy right now, but it soon could be. AAPL stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 125.49. But in a negative sign, shares are trading below their 50-day moving average line.  The new base is part of a larger, eight-week consolidation with a buy point of 138.08, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.  Keep an eye on the overall stock market, which has been unsettled lately.

Over the weekend, Epic countered in a new court filing and argued that the Mac maker has a monopoly on iOS content distribution, highlighting the key antitrust criticism that regulators and lawmakers have been expressing in recent years.  Here s the latest development in the dispute.  Apple s view is ""misguided""  ""When Epic took steps to allow consumers on iOS devices to make [in-app purchase] payments directly, it breached some of the contractual restrictions that Apple imposes on iOS developers,"" Epic wrote in the latest filing. ""Epic did so because those contractual restrictions are unlawful.""  Epic is referring to the direct payment system that it activated in August, which it knew would trigger swift retaliation from the Cupertino tech giant since Epic was bypassing the App Store and its 30% cut of digital sales. It was a drastic move, as approximately 73 million people play Fortnite exclusively on iOS, which was disclosed in a filing earlier this month. The developer is leveraging the popularity of Fortnite to take a principled stand against Apple, even if that means a large chunk of the player base gets caught in the crossfire.  ""Epic [activated the direct payment system] believing, as it still does, that Apple s contractual restrictions are anticompetitive, denying choice to developers and consumers alike,"" Epic continues. ""Epic did so to show that these restrictions are not a necessary part of the iOS ecosystem; they are just the tools Apple uses to maintain its monopoly.""  Apple often cites privacy and security as primary justifications for its strict App Store guidelines. Epic notes that Apple has not alleged that Epic s direct payment system hurt security and privacy of users in any way, somewhat undermining that rationale.  Epic CEO Tim Sweeney argues that Apple s position is ""misguided.""  What s most disturbing about Apple s position is that they seem to truly believe they ""own"" all commerce involving phones they make, characterizing direct payment as theft, smuggling, and even shoplifting. It s a crazy, misguided view.https://t.co/dAOkE8fW4S — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) October 25, 2020  The digital content that Epic sells within Fortnite is the result of its own creative efforts, and Apple ""has no right to the fruits of Epic s labor,"" the smaller company maintains.  A matter of perspective  Epic is smartly aligning its arguments with broader antitrust concerns. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee released a report detailing the findings of a lengthy antitrust investigation into major tech corporations. Lawmakers similarly alleged that the App Store represents an illegal monopoly, but Apple defended itself by arguing that the App Store represents a small part of the overall market for all software distribution. It s a matter of perspective.  Epic says that if it fails to prove its antitrust claims when the case goes to trial next summer, it will ""be responsible for any sums owed to Apple."""
65,2020-10-27,07:45:00,AAPL,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/27/better-buy-nvidia-vs-qualcomm/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,Better Buy: NVIDIA vs. Qualcomm,"NVIDIA  and Qualcomm  are established tech giants positioning themselves for prosperity in the new economy. Both appear to have successfully redefined themselves to do well in today s tech industry.  However, investors should not assume that these two companies are going to thrive equally. Both companies compete in separate parts of the tech industry and contend with differing competitive conditions.  Let s take a closer look at both NVIDIA and Qualcomm to see which might make a more lucrative investment given the competitive environment each operates in.  The opportunities ahead  Despite each being generally designated as semiconductor stocks, the two companies have little in common. NVIDIA drew its picture of success by manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs), while Qualcomm excels by specializing in chips for smartphones.  NVIDIA has come a long way from the days when it provided GPUs primarily to enhance gaming capabilities in PCs. The company has since applied its strengths to provide chips for artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and other applications. Thanks to the ray-tracing technology NVIDIA introduced in 2018, it has become a leader in numerous areas such as supercomputing, robotics, and self-driving cars.  However, it has also attracted a formidable competitor in Advanced Micro Devices . AMD formed a Radeon Technologies Group division in 2015. In time, AMD s new division helped it begin to gain market share. NVIDIA has managed to fight back, and it should remain the market leader for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, NVIDIA will face continuous competitive pressures in this market.  This is not the case with Qualcomm, which connects with customers and investors through its smartphone chipsets. This has made manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung dependent on its technology. It has also attracted lawsuits from Apple and antitrust suits from the government.  With the onset of 5G networking, conditions have turned in Qualcomm s favor. The company got the ruling that it was a ""monopoly"" overturned, paving the way for 5G phone sales. Moreover, Apple settled its lawsuits with Qualcomm, though it also bought Intel s smartphone chipset business. This means Qualcomm could face competition in the future.  The stocks compared  During 2020, NVIDIA has delivered a stronger performance by far between the two companies. Their stock prices paralleled each other at the beginning of the year, but NVIDIA s stock price has experienced significantly higher growth than Qualcomm since February.  However, NVIDIA investors must also pay a higher premium to buy the stock. At a forward P/E ratio of more than 50, its stock price comes in far ahead of the 21 forward multiple of Qualcomm.  In fairness, new NVIDIA investors will buy a great deal of growth. Analysts project earnings will grow by 57% this year. Also, in the most recent quarter, non-GAAP earnings increased by 76% from year-ago levels.  Still, reaction to COVID-19 and the demands it created may have driven much of that growth as millions found themselves needing to work from home. The pandemic will run its course at some point. Consequently, analysts project NVIDIA s earnings growth will be reduced to 21% year over year in the upcoming fiscal year.  The story is different for Qualcomm, as non-GAAP earnings rose by 8% from year-ago levels in its most recent quarter. This is similar to forecasts for the current year, as analysts predict an 11% year-over-year profit increase.  Nonetheless, with the release of the 5G iPhone from Apple, Qualcomm appears positioned to benefit from a multiyear upgrade cycle. For next year, projections point to a 65% increase in net income. Moreover, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate for smartphone chipsets of 63% through 2027. This indicates Qualcomm s massive growth can continue for a long time to come.  NVIDIA or Qualcomm?  NVIDIA stock has recently outperformed Qualcomm and should deliver outsized returns for years to come. However, investors have to look to the future. With the massive profit increases that will probably come from the 5G upgrade cycle, Qualcomm is the stock more likely to deliver higher returns going forward.  The uptrend should continue for several years as smartphone users upgrade to 5G. Additionally, prospective shareholders who buy now can acquire Qualcomm stock at a significant discount to NVIDIA s current valuation.  Investors should profit regardless of which stock they choose. Nonetheless, Qualcomm s low cost and 5G market dominance is a value proposition with too much potential to ignore."

You re just the recipient of Apple s 4-for-1 stock split and were given 3 additional shares for every one share of Apple stock you owned. The total value of your stocks doesn t change and you don t have to stay up all night learning the latest tax laws. A stock split does not impact your taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes -- unless you decide to sell your shares.  How does a stock split work?  When a stock split occurs for popular company stocks, new investors may be enticed to buy company shares in hopes that they will hit the stock jackpot. But a stock split doesn t increase your earnings; It gives you more shares in your account while keeping the total value of the stocks in your account the same. The shares are just listed at a cheaper price, making the company stock more affordable to a broader range of investors.  For example, let s say you owned one share of stock that was worth $400 before the split. After a 4-for-1 stock split, you now own 4 shares of stock that are valued at $100 per share for a total value of $400. As you can see, the value didn t change -- your stocks are still worth $400. Your original piece of the pie was just split into four different slices.  Kiss your tax anxieties goodbye  So, relax. Stock splits are one move in the markets that won t give you a headache during tax time. Unlike selling a stock or earning dividends, a stock split does not increase your income in itself. You may have received additional shares in your account, but you didn t receive additional money in your hands as a result of the stock split.  A stock split has nothing to do with your tax returns because it is not a taxable event. Any time you receive unexpected ""gifts"" from major companies, you always have to consider how it will impact your taxes. A stock split is a different type of gift -- it s a gift that adds more shares to your account without you having to do anything in return!  What happens if you sell shares of stock after a stock split?  A stock split gives you the ""enjoy your life and forget about taxes"" pass -- no action required on your behalf when a stock split occurs. But if you get too antsy and decide to sell shares of stock after a split, there are taxes to pay. The IRS requires you to pay either short-term or long-term capital gains taxes on any profits you receive in the stock market.  Let s say you held your investment in Apple for a year or less (short-term), you will pay the same rate of taxes that you pay on your income from working a job. But you can enjoy a better deal on taxes if you held your investment for over a year (long-term). See the special tax rates for 2020 long-term capital gains below.  For single filers with taxable income of... For married joint filers with taxable income of... For heads of households with taxable income of... ...this is the long-term capital gains rate $0 to $40,000 $0 to $80,000 $0 to $53,600 0% $40,000 to $441,450 $80,000 to $496,600 $53,600 to $469,050 15% Over $441,550 Over $496,600 Over $469,050 20%  DATA SOURCE: IRS.  Earning profits from selling shares of stock comes with more paperwork during tax time -- add Form 8949-Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets to your ""to-do"" list. Don t panic -- your brokerage firm does most of the hard work for you. You ll receive a Form 1099-B during tax time to help you report your cost basis -- the price you paid for the stock -- as well as short- and long-term capital gains.  But, if you haven t touched your stocks since Apple s stock split in August, you can keep investing and focusing on the long term so you can enjoy those favorable tax benefits!"

Though many tech companies will be releasing their latest quarterly results this week, three definitely worth watching are tech giants Amazon  Facebook , Apple . All three of these companies are slated to report quarterly results after market close on Thursday.  Ahead of their earnings reports, here s a quick preview of some items related to each company that will be worth checking on.  Amazon: Did revenue soar again?  E-commerce and cloud-computing giant Amazon absolutely obliterated analyst estimates when it reported second-quarter results in July. Net sales soared 40% year over year to an all-time record of $88.9 billion. Net income jumped from $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter to $5.2 billion. The ongoing adoption of e-commerce was accelerated during the quarter as consumers sheltered at home.  While investors are planning for a deceleration in Amazon s revenue growth rate in Q3, they are still expecting impressive growth. On average, analysts forecast third-quarter revenue to rise about 32% year over year.  Investors should also look to Amazon s guidance for the important holiday quarter. On average, the consensus analyst forecast for the period currently calls for 27% year-over-year growth.  Apple: Can services keep up its momentum?  Tech giant Apple surprised investors when it reported double-digit revenue growth and growth in every single product segment and geography in its last quarter. The strong business performance highlighted the resiliency of Apple s business model during trying times. Did Apple keep up this momentum in fiscal Q3?  Analysts were shooting in the dark when it came to estimating Apple s revenue growth for its just-ended fiscal fourth quarter, as management didn t provide any guidance. On average, analysts are expecting revenue for the period to be about flat compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, earnings per share is expected to decline about 7%.  Investors should check in on Apple s services business. As the company s second-largest segment, the lucrative segment is becoming increasingly important to a long-term thesis for Apple stock. Did the service business keep up a similar growth rate as it achieved in fiscal Q3, its revenue increased 15% year over year?  Facebook: A critical look at advertising spend trends  Facebook s third-quarter report will be particularly interesting since it will help investors get a good look at how global advertising spend is faring during these uncertain times. In Q2, Facebook s year-over-year advertising revenue growth rate slowed to 10% -- down from 17% in the first quarter of 2020.  Analysts are largely expecting another quarter of slower growth compared to before the coronavirus. On average, analysts are modeling for the tech company s advertising revenue to grow about 12% year over year in Q3.  Just as is the case with Amazon, investors should look for any insight into management s expectations for the important holiday quarter. Advertising spend typically jumps sharply sequentially in Q4. But there s a lot of uncertainty surrounding how 2020 s holiday season could play out."

(Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Amazon <AMZN.O> and Facebook <FB.O>, together accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500 s total value, report their quarterly results on Thursday, with their stocks trading near record highs, even as they face increasing antitrust scrutiny.
Amazon and Apple have surged 74% and 57%, respectively, this year, far outperforming the S&P 500 s 5% gain as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates trends toward online shopping, video streaming and other technologies helping Wall Street s largest companies take market share from smaller rivals.
Big Tech for years has been criticized for choking competition and stifling smaller competitors, and investors are looking for signs that they are extending their lead during the pandemic. However, antitrust storm clouds in recent months have increased.
A scathing report by a House of Representatives panel this month detailing abuses of market power by large tech companies suggests a tough road ahead should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in polls, win the Nov. 3 election.
""There seems to be a lot of angst and desire to not only fine these companies, but potentially change the way they do their business. In the past, there was a lot of lip service, but now you are starting to see some pretty active postures,"" said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.
Morgan said he expects to see companies set money aside to pay for potential future fines.
Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have a combined stock market value of $5.5 trillion, compared to the S&P 500 s $29 trillion market capitalization.
Their reports come amid turbulence on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 <.SPX> on Monday posting its biggest daily decline in four weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and uncertainty about a fiscal relief bill in Washington dim the outlook for an economic recovery.
Microsoft <MSFT.O>, which posts its results late on Tuesday, has elevated its stock market value by a third in 2020 to $1.6 trillion. Investors expect the software maker to report an 8% rise in quarterly revenue and a 10% jump in net income, with Cowen analyst Derrick Wood saying in a recent client note that Windows sales could get a lift from additional laptop demand as people keep working from home.
S&P 500 technology sector earnings per share are seen rising 0.3% in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
By comparison, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to see an aggregate decline of 16.7% in their third-quarter earnings as the U.S. economy remains crippled by the pandemic.
Amazon s September-quarter report will likely be a ""calm before the storm"" as the online retailer builds more fulfillment centers in anticipation of a busy holiday shopping season, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a client note on Monday.
""With a holiday crunch expected, the scale and pace at which (Amazon) is bringing incremental capacity online is encouraging,"" Shmulik wrote.
Twitter also reports its results on Thursday, with analysts on average expecting a 9% revenue decline as advertisers hurt by the pandemic spend less.
Analysts on average expect Apple s report after the bell on Thursday to reflect a 0.5% drop in revenue to $63.7 billion and net income down 11.2% to $12.1 billion. However, Apple investors are mostly focused on the outlook for sales of the newest iPhone and growth in recurring revenue from apps, games and video and music streaming."
70,2020-10-27,03:55:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-100000090.html,"Apple Plans Smaller AirPods Pro, Revamped Entry-Level Model","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning updates to its AirPods earbuds next year, seeking to capitalize on the success of a product that has become an important source of growth.
The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on two new models: third-generation entry-level AirPods and the second version of the AirPods Pro earbuds, according to people familiar with the plans.
The models will join other new Apple audio devices like the HomePod mini and upcoming over-ear headphones. The company has also weighed launching another smart speaker that would sit between the HomePod mini and the original version in the line up.
The design of the updated entry-level AirPods will be similar to the current AirPods Pro, gaining a shorter stem and replaceable ear tips. Apple is also looking to improve battery life. That model however will not have higher-end AirPods Pro features like noise-cancellation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.
For the new AirPods Pro, Apple is aiming to make the earbuds more compact by eliminating the short stem that currently sticks out from the bottom. A design in testing has a more rounded shape that fills more of a user’s a ear -- similar to the latest designs from Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Google.
Integrating noise-cancellation, wireless antennas and microphones into a smaller AirPods Pro casing has proved challenging during development, which could result in a less ambitious design when the product is finalized, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Apple has internally discussed launching the new low-end AirPods during the first half of next year. The company is also planning new wireless chips to power both models. Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Goertek Inc. are expected to handle most of the production for the new earbuds.
Goertek, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from Apple, jumped 2.5% to a record in Shenzhen trading Tuesday. Luxshare inched up 0.2%, after having more than doubled this year.
After being mocked by some early on, AirPods have become one of Apple’s biggest hits in recent years. The company’s Wearables, Home and Accessories division, which includes AirPods, reported $6.5 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up more than 70% from two years ago. The earbuds may get a new sales boost soon because Apple stopped including headphones with new iPhones.
The success has attracted rivals such as China’s Xiaomi Corp. that offer more affordable options.

Apple currently sells entry-level AirPods for $159 and the AirPods Pro at $249. The original AirPods launched in 2016 and were last updated in March 2019. The AirPods Pro came out in October last year.
Beyond the new AirPods, Apple has also internally weighed a new HomePod that sits in size, price and sound quality between the original $299 HomePod and the $99 HomePod mini. It’s unclear if Apple will ultimately launch that product or just further cut the price of the higher-end version.
Apple is still planning to announce high-end, noise-canceling over-ear headphones. The device has faced several development challenges over the past two years and has been delayed multiple times.
The headphones were due to go into production weeks ago, but that was pushed back due to problems with the headband, a person familiar with the matter said. That part was deemed too tight in some testing.

The company initially wanted to include large touch pads on the sides of the headphones, but reduced the size of those panels. Apple has also scaled back some of the interchangeable functionality of the headphones that were a hallmark of the initial concept. The latest version of the product is likely to lack a replaceable headband, but could still include interchangeable ear pads.

71,2020-10-27,00:30:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-succession-plans-complicated-lee-043031609.html,Samsung Succession Plans Complicated by Lees Risk of Jail Time,"(Bloomberg) -- Jay Y. Lee has been groomed for decades to take over Samsung Group, the conglomerate founded by his grandfather and built by his father into a technology giant. Yet even after the death of Lee Kun-hee on Sunday, his only son will likely have to wait a bit longer for his ascension.
The younger Lee is in the midst of two trials over allegations he used bribery and accounting trickery to smooth his succession. While he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, Lee faces the possibility of returning to jail if he is convicted. Samsung may hold off on naming Lee to his father’s role as chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. at least until the first trial is completed in the coming months, avoiding a scenario where the newly minted chairman goes to prison.
That means Samsung would operate without a chairman for at least a few more months, a lack of clear leadership that could hurt many companies. But Samsung Electronics has respected executives who run the key operations, and Lee already holds the title of vice chairman to make broader, strategic decisions as needed.
“I think Jay Y. Lee will be promoted to chairman early next year,” said Lee Sang-hun, analyst at HI Investment & Securities. “He might also wait until the bribery case is finalized.”
Samsung declined to comment. The company hasn’t said who will take over the chairman position or when.
The timing of Lee’s formal ascension is sensitive given how public dissatisfaction with the country’s powerful conglomerates, or chaebols, has grown in past years. That backlash stems in part from the high-profile allegations of graft against Lee, which triggered the impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye.
Also complicating the succession is an enormous inheritance tax bill the Lee family will have to pay, possibly loosening their control over the conglomerate. The elder Lee had an estimated fortune of $20.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and could owe about $10 billion because of the country’s high rates.
Samsung Heirs Owe Billions in Taxes. Here’s How They Might Pay
Most families choose to pay such taxes in cash rather than in stock to maintain control, said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive officer of Seoul-based corporate-analysis firm Chaebul.com. They can take five years to make the payments, he said.
There’s little doubt the 52-year-old Lee will succeed his father eventually. The younger Lee, who is trilingual, studied at Japan’s Keio University and Harvard Business School after receiving an undergraduate degree from Seoul National University, the nation’s top school. He has brought a more global approach to Samsung’s management, forging relationships with key partners like the late Steve Jobs.
While Samsung Electronics is best known globally for its smartphones and appliances, it makes most of its money by supplying companies like Apple Inc. with components such as memory chips and panels.
Chang Sea-Jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, said the alternatives to simply promoting Lee may be worse. Naming an interim chairman from the Samsung executive ranks, for example, would complicate decision making by adding an extra management layer, he said. There would be valuable clarity in Lee taking on his father’s role, he said.
“I think he should take the chairmanship now,” said Chang. “Whatever the circumstances, he has to make the decisions.”
Samsung can’t afford to drift. The company faces renewed challenges from Apple and the rise of tough Chinese competitors in smartphones, along with chronic pricing difficulties in memory chips. Samsung is also embarking on expensive initiatives in fifth-generation wireless technology and the semiconductor foundry industry. Samsung Electronics reports results Thursday.
Samsung Low-Profile Heir Poised to Succeed Father Seen as a God
Chang pointed out that Lee wouldn’t have to run individual business units because of the professional managers who steer the operations. That’s a marked contrast to the early days of his father’s tenure, when the elder Lee got deeply involved in key divisions.
“He doesn’t have to be another Lee Kun-hee; they have much stronger professional management,” Chang said. “He should be a different kind of chairman than his father.”
Lee’s legal troubles could drag on for years. A retrial of bribery and corruption allegations will unfold this year, with a decision likely early next year. A newer case about alleged accounting wrongdoing will get under way again in January and will likely take months.
Such prosecutions don’t carry the same kind of stigma in South Korea as they do in many other countries. Lee Kun-hee was convicted twice -- and pardoned twice. The chairman of SK Group was also jailed in 2013, then returned to his company in 2016 where he remains at the helm.
Chang joked that prison is almost like “graduate school” for the country’s business leaders.
“Eventually we should move away from this environment in South Korea and have the same standards as other countries,” he said.
